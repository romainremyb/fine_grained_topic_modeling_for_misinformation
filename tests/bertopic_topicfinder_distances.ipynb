      "Virus Origin and bioweapon theory -> We’ve been asked to look into claims that the Covid-19 virus hasn’t been isolated, doesn’t fulfil “Koch’s postulates”, and that this means PCR diagnosis tests aren’t working.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inIsolating a virusFirstly it is incorrect to say that the virus that causes Covid-19 has not been isolated.Isolating a virus means taking a pure sample of a virus from an infected being so it can be studied. There are numerous reports of the virus being isolated by teams around the world.“SARS-CoV2 has been sampled millions of times over from infected people, including those originally found to be infected in China,” Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist and Associate Professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, told Full Fact.Koch’s postulatesIt’s also incorrect to say that the virus that causes Covid-19 would need to meet Koch’s postulates, primarily because Koch’s postulates weren’t written for viruses.Koch’s postulates were a set of rules outlined by scientist Robert Koch in 1890 to decide whether a bacteria causes a disease. The original four criteria are:“1. The microorganism must be found in the diseased animal, and not found in healthy animals.“2. The microorganism must be extracted and isolated from the diseased animal and subsequently grown in culture.“3. The microorganism must cause disease when introduced to a healthy experimental animal.“4. The microorganism must be extracted from the diseased experimental animal and demonstrated to be the same microorganism that was originally isolated from the first diseased animal.”As noted by many, these criteria were written before the discovery of viruses, so fail to include them in their consideration of what a disease is.Dr Griffin outlined other shortcomings in Koch’s rules.“The first postulate in particular is void as even at Koch’s time (which he later admitted)” he told us. “Folks knew that you could catch e.g. Cholera without necessarily becoming unwell - asymptomatic infection is a massive issue for these ideas (first and third postulates), as is the arrival of molecular biology!”Another of Koch’s postulates was that bacteria must be able to be isolated from the host. Viruses, unlike bacteria, require host cells in which to replicate, so also cannot be isolated in the same way Koch defined with bacteria, which according to Dr Griffin, required “culture as in a flask of media, so viruses don’t fit this idea.”So simply put, Koch’s postulates are not a good measure of what causes disease in 2020.PCR testsWe also know that PCR tests are identifying the virus that causes Covid-19 and working well.As we have written before, PCR tests used in Covid-19 testing are extremely sensitive and specific at detecting Covid-19 and do not confuse other coronaviruses, such as ones that cause the common cold, for Covid-19.“The PCR test is incredibly stringent and specific, requires two separate reactions to be positive ... and EVERY test is also sequenced, so we know it is SARS-CoV2 and not another virus,” said Dr Griffin.So in summary, Covid-19 has been isolated, Koch’s postulates don’t have to universally apply for something to cause disease, and tests to identify the Covid-19 virus do work.\n",
      "Virus contraction (who contracts the virus) and transmission (what transmits the virus) -> The StatementA widely-shared Facebook post features a medical text from 1989 and claims that coronaviruses equal the common cold.The post is titled, “From the AMA encyclopedia of disease published 1989, page 1051. Corona is a cold” and shows an excerpt from the American Medical Association Encyclopedia. Under a heading “Types of Virus”, the page shows depictions of different diseases and lists the virus family with examples of related symptoms. Among the viruses listed is “Coronaviruses” and written next to it in the conditions column is “Common Cold.”The post includes the comment, “American Medical Association Encyclopedia, published 1989. Coronaviruses = common cold. Print off and put in EVERY police station letterbox or post with words, ‘Jail Politicians’ written on the back’.”The July 10 post has attracted 1.1 million views and more than 520 shares.The AnalysisThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family – a group of viruses linked to the SARS and MERS respiratory infections and some types of common cold, according to the World Health Organization.WHO lists common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, and tiredness but can also “range from no symptoms… to severe pneumonia or death”.The US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lists symptoms of the common cold to include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches. The CDC also says many different respiratory viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common.The CDC also states on its website that the “virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.”Viral infectious diseases expert Professor Damian Purcell from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, says coronaviruses do cause common colds, but to circulate such a statement as contained in the Facebook post during a coronavirus pandemic is misleading.“It’s quite important when talking about this particular strain of virus, not to call it a coronavirus or coronaviruses,” Prof Purcell told AAP FactCheck“It should be called SARS CoV 2, and the name means severe acute respiratory syndrome. Strictly speaking the American Medical Association in 1989 were completely correct in saying coronaviruses cause the common cold, but it’s absolutely misleading to say that about SARS Covid 2.“It’s the difference between saying something is seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza which killed millions of people.”Prof Purcell said while the AMA’s “sweeping statement” was true of its time, it’s important to note that it was made before the SARS epidemic (2002-2003).“Before this coronaviruses were only associated with the common cold,” he said.The VerdictBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be partly false. While it is true that common colds are associated with human coronaviruses, the post’s claim that coronaviruses equal a common cold is not accurate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that different respiratory viruses cause the common cold with rhinoviruses the most common.Partly False – The claims of the content are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate.* AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/All information, text and images included on the AAP Websites is for personal use only and may not be re-written, copied, re-sold or re-distributed, framed, linked, shared onto social media or otherwise used whether for compensation of any kind or not, unless you have the prior written permission of AAP.

      "Incidence, Mortality and 'Casedemic' -> “As many as 56% of people in some parts of England are only diagnosed [with lung cancer] when they visit A&E”“They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme”“…diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits”The Guardian, 31 January 2020An article published last month in the Guardian contains several claims about the route to lung cancer diagnosis and subsequent survival rates for patients in England. These claims come from information provided by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition.Firstly, it claims that the proportion of lung cancer cases only diagnosed after a visit to an A&E ranges from 15% in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey to 56% in Tower Hamlets and Manchester. That’s not correct, the range is less than that.Secondly, the article claims that patients diagnosed following an A&E visit are five times more likely to die compared to other diagnosis routes, when the correct figure is around three times.Thirdly, it claims that the diagnoses occur in A&E because GPs miss signs of the disease, which is just one reason why a diagnosis may occur at A&E.The figures on cancer diagnosisWe looked at the underlying data and found that the differences across the country and survival rates by diagnosis route were not as pronounced as had been claimed.In addition, these figures include diagnoses following “any emergency presentation” to secondary care, not just through A&E. As explained above, that can include things like an emergency GP referral.The estimated proportion of lung cancers diagnosed following an emergency presentation ranged from 26% in Harrogate and Rural District to 47% in Tower Hamlets.So there was a 21 percentage point difference between the areas with the lowest and highest estimated proportion of lung cancers diagnosed following this route, not a 41 point difference as the article suggested.However, we don’t know exactly what proportion of diagnoses came about because of A&E attendances, as (unlike the national data) the local data wasn’t broken down in that amount of detail.We spoke to Professor Mick Peake, chair of the UK Lung Cancer Coalition, who quoted the incorrect figures for Guildford and Waverley and Tower Hamlets reported in the article. He said that he had mistakenly quoted numbers from the wrong data column, but that this did not alter the message of the article.Are patients diagnosed after an A&E visit five times more likely to die?Between 2012 and 2016, 17% of people with lung cancer diagnosed after an emergency presentation survived at least 12-months post diagnosis. This was the lowest rate of all diagnosis routes.The diagnosis route with the highest 12-month survival rate was those people diagnosed after an ‘other outpatient visit’, which includes self-referrals, consultant to consultant referral, and other or unknown referrals. There were 54% in this group who survived 12 months between 2012 and 2016.For patients diagnosed following a GP referral, their 12-month survival rate was 49%. This is almost three times the survival rate of people diagnosed after an emergency presentation, not five timesWe think the Guardian article was quoting a statistic presented in a now-deleted press release about a new report from the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. The press release mentions a statistic about survival rates by stage of cancer at diagnosis published by the Office of National Statistics.Between 2013 and 2017, the estimated age-adjusted rate of 1-year survival following lung cancer diagnoses was 88% for people diagnosed early (stage 1 cancer) compared with 19% for cancers diagnosed late (stage 4). This is roughly a five-fold difference. This data is not broken down by diagnosis route.We’ve asked the UK Lung Cancer Coalition for more information.Are lung cancers being diagnosed late because GPs miss symptoms?There is research suggesting that some late diagnoses may represent missed opportunities for GPs to identify lung cancer. However, this does not mean that all diagnoses following an emergency presentation is due to GPs missing early symptoms.A University of Nottingham study published in 2015 looked at the difference between lung cancer patients who survived or died within 90 days of diagnosis. Patients who died earlier were more likely to interact with primary care in the run up to diagnosis. The authors of the study suggest that these likely represent some missed opportunities for GPs to identify lung cancer earlier. However, this does not mean that all diagnoses that happen at a later stage or after an emergency presentation are because GPs miss signs of lung cancer.As mentioned further down the Guardian article, “GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality”.\n",
      "Prevention (Face Mask, Vitamin D, etc.) -> Children Are At Risk Of Contracting COVID-19 And Should Wear MasksDoctors say children can die from COVID-19 and US health authorities recommend that most youngsters over the age of two wear masks.\"\"Get rid of mask orders!! Let our kids breathe,\"\" demands an August 17, 2020 Facebook post which shared an \"\"Un-mask our kids\"\" flyer.The flyer was created by Jodie Meschuk, who has more than 36,000 Instagram followers and often posts anti-mask and anti-vaccination content.The link in Meschuk's profile offers an easily downloadable version of the flyer from a Dropbox account, leading others to share it on Facebook, including here, here and here. It was also shared on Twitter.What is known about how COVID-19 affects children is continually being updated by the scientific community, but multiple doctors told AFP that the flyer makes false and misleading claims, and disregards advice that children should wear masks to help curb the spread of the disease.Also Read: Does Using \"\"Temperature Gun\"\" Damage The Pineal Gland In The Brain?Claim 1: 'The chance of a child dying from COVID-19 rounds to zero'According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in children younger than 18 are asymptomatic or mild.Current evidence from North America and China suggests that children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants might be at increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.Dr Dean Blumberg, Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UC Davis Health, told AFP by phone: \"\"Children are less likely to get infected compared to adults when they're exposed to an infectious case, but they still do get infected. And we know that children have died from COVID-19.\"\"This was echoed by Dr Erin Silverman, clinical research coordinator at the University of Florida College of Medicine.\"\"We know that COVID-19 is less fatal in children than adults and children are less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19,\"\" Silverman said in an email.However, she cautioned that the number and rate of cases in children in the United States has been steadily increasing from March to July 2020, with the percentage of children with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization also on the rise.\"\"Nearly 100 kids have died as a direct result of COVID-19 this year. The claim that you can take that number and 'round to zero' isn't as comforting if it's your child or the child of someone you care about dying,\"\" Silverman said.Blumberg also pointed to the post-infection risk of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), which causes multiple organs to become painfully inflamed.\"\"Those children are quite ill, many of them in the intensive care unit,\"\" he explained.Claim 2: 'The chances of an asymptomatic child transmitting COVID-19 rounds to zero'An August 19 CDC publication for pediatric health care workers reported that 16 percent of children with a SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic. While this study from France suggested it could be as many as 45 percent of infected children.Dr Benjamin Lee, associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Vermont, said by email: \"\"The chance of an asymptomatic child transmitting COVID-19 is low, but is not zero, and nobody in the scientific community has ever argued that children are incapable of transmitting the virus.\"\"Dr Sunil Sood, chairman of Pediatrics - Infectious Disease at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital, agreed, telling AFP by phone that there is no biological reason that a child would not be able to transmit the virus to somebody else.Also Read: Plandemic Sequel Clip Makes Misleading Claims About COVID-19 VaccineClaim 3: 'Children and anyone healthy are extremely resilient and natural exposure to viruses helps build an even stronger immunity.'University of Vermont's Lee explained that this claim is misleading.\"\"The adverse consequences of infection with many viruses can be devastating -- which is why vaccines against them were developed,\"\" he said. \"\"Nobody would trade 'stronger immunity' to poliovirus for the paralysis that might result from natural infection.\"\"Lee also pointed to this study, which found \"\"measles infection can greatly diminish previously acquired immune memory, potentially leaving individuals at risk for infection by other pathogens.\"\"The University of Florida's Silverman also pointed to the measles in saying, \"\"Vaccines are much, much safer than non-vaccine exposure.\"\"Claim 4: Wearing a mask will lead to a slow build-up of CO2.AFP Fact Check has previously debunked false claims that mask-wearing will lead to hypoxia, a lack of oxygen in the body, or hypercapnia, a build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood.Lee agreed, saying: \"\"There is no scientific evidence that wearing a mask causes a slow build-up of CO2 in quantities sufficient to cause health effects.\"\"\"\"CO2 is a gas, made up of individual molecules infinitesimally smaller than even a virus, and can easily diffuse through cloth. To argue that masks cause a significant build-up of CO2 is akin to arguing that cloth facial coverings are air-tight.\"\"This was echoed by the American Academy of Pediatrics.Claim 5: Wearing a mask will lead to 'suffocation for babies or toddlers who cannot communicate when they need more oxygen'No public health agency recommends masks for babies.The CDC recommends children older than two wear a mask over their nose and mouth when in public settings in which it is difficult to practice social distancing.As of August 21, the World Health Organization advises that children under age five not be required to wear a mask.UC Davis's Blumberg said mask exemptions should extend to any child who cannot safely remove the mask themselves, including \"\"older children who may have impaired neurodevelopment.\"\"Also Read: Anti-mask Posts Use Fake WHO Document To Spread MisinformationClaim 6: Wearing a mask will lead to 'inhaling micro-mold caused by trapped water vapors from exhalation'Asked about this claim, Sood, an expert in infectious diseases, said: \"\"It is just completely false and baseless.\"\"\"\"The mask itself is not a risk,\"\" he said.The CDC recommends everyone wash and completely dry cloth face coverings after each wearing.If a mask gets wet, it is advisable to change it, but Blumberg, who specializes in preventing and treating childhood infections, said: \"\"Even if they do get wet by the child's own mouth -- their own oral fora -- they've already been exposed to those bacteria… so that's not going to expose them to additional bacteria.\"\"Claim 7: Wearing a mask will lead to 'ingestion of bacteria or parasites on the mask from kids' unwashed hands touching it'Good hand hygiene is key to avoiding infection from the novel coronavirus and other bacteria or parasites.Lee said, \"\"Pinworms and diarrheal illnesses have been with us from time immemorial, long before COVID-19. There is no evidence to suggest that these infections have been occurring more frequently in areas where more children are wearing masks.\"\"\"\"Ultimately, we are not putting children at risk by asking that they wear a mask. When everyone wears a mask, even children, that makes everyone's child more safe,\"\" Lee added.AFP Fact Check has debunked numerous false and misleading claims about face masks.

      "Treatment (Ivermectim, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, etc) -> Have multiple studies shown that countries treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine suffer fewer deaths than those like the U.S. where its use is restricted? No, that's not true: The claim was made without citing any such studies. Lead Stories has not found peer-reviewed clinical studies that declare hydroxychloroquine is a cure, and the World Health Organization has declared the opposite putting a stop to a multi-national test of the drug when French and British researchers found it does not cut the mortality rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and may contribute to heart problems.The claim appeared in a video posted to YouTube on August 1, 2020, titled, \"\"Studies show countries using hydroxychloroquine have far fewer COVID-19 deaths\"\" (archived here), which opened:While the media continues to slam the use of hydroxychloroquine, numerous studies have revealed countries that used the drug are doing much better than those that haven't. One America's Pearson Sharp has the details.Click below to watch the video on YouTube:This One America News video makes several claims that either cannot be substantiated or have been rejected by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control.'Numerous studies' claimed -- but no citations or titles providedThe video refers to \"\"numerous studies,\"\" but does not provide the author nor title of any specific study.Although Dr. David Nazarian of Los Angeles, California, is not interviewed on camera and the time and place of his comments is not provided by the narrator, the One America News video says (at time code 1:00) that Nazarian says patients taking hydroxychloroquine are doing better than those who aren't.Board certified in internal medicine, Nazarian operates My Concierge MD, Executive Health in Los Angeles, California. On his website, he says he has worked as an emergency room doctor, as a doctor providing medical service on movie production sites and as a hospitalist. As a medical student, his website says, he served a one-month rotation in 2008 in epidemiology, the study of how diseases spread. He lists one scholarly publication, a 2004 journal article about stroke medication. Lead Stories reached out to Nazarian by phone and email on August 3, 2020, to check the research and statements attributed to him. This story will be updated, if appropriate, when Nazarian replies.Describing Nazarian as having conducted a study, the One America News narrator says:He points to countries in Africa where hydroxychloroquine is taken widely and prophylactically to protect against diseases like malaria. Incidentally, these countries have some of the lowest levels of coronavirus infections and deaths anywhere in the world.Here's the video segment containing the reference to Nazarian's research and analysis:Later in the video, the One America News narrator says \"\"doctors say\"\" hydroxychloroquine could cure between 70% to 90% of the patients diagnosed with the disease and that a Yale University School of Public Health professor of epidemiology, Dr. Harvey Risch, agrees that it could easily save 100,000 Americans.Risch, who also holds a Ph.D., specializes in cancer research and has, according to Yale's website, published hundreds of scholarly articles, told Lead Stories in an August 3, 2020, email exchange that One America's video \"\"is somewhat approximate of what I said, at the end of a Laura Ingraham episode.\"\" He appeared on the July 21 episode of \"\"The Ingraham Angle,\"\" on which he said the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine for outpatients could save thousands of lives. He told Lead Stories:What I did say is that if HCQ became immediately available and into use, some 50,000-100,000 lives could be saved.Though the One America News report does not refer to it, Risch told Lead Stories he has recently written a letter accepted for publication in the American Journal of Epidemiology taking issue with research into hydroxychloroquine. In it, he criticizes the study by which hydroxychloroquine was ruled out as a treatment for COVID-19 and calls attention to other clinical studies that say hydroxychloroquine will save COVID-19 patients. He discloses in his letter that he has done consulting work for two of the 50 manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline, but not on those drugs and not in the last two years and that he has not planned future work with those pharmaceutical companies. Such disclosures are not unusual in medical journals, as much research is underwritten by corporate sponsors.The basis for claims that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19Contradicting current findings of the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization, Risch told Lead Stories \"\"it is also completely possible that the medication cuts the mortality by two-thirds\"\" although he concedes a claim like his, based on a review of someone else's clinical studies, is hard to assess.In 150 days there would be 100,000 lives saved in this scenario. That's 5 months. There are some assumptions in this of course, but all within reasonableness. The one-half-to-two-thirds is in the range of the various studies showing positive benefit in risk reduction for hospitalization or mortality of high-risk outpatients, the people most likely to die if they are not treated.Risch told Lead Stories he does not treat patients with COVID-19, but bases his estimates on clinical studies he has reviewed, plus his contention that the World Health Organization and FDA decisions were based on weak evidence. \"\"The whole system was wrong, to allow fraudulent papers to be uncritically peer-reviewed and vetted by the journal editors-in-chief.\"\" Risch is Editor of the American Journal of Cancer.FDA and WHO findings about hydroxychloroquineIn declaring hydroxychloroquine a life-saving COVID-19 drug, the One America News video narrator adds, at 2:38 on the timecode: \"\"That means that radical leftist governors and politicians in Washington have allowed nearly 140,000 Americans to die just to prove President Trump wrong.\"\"But, Washington-based agencies originally agreed with President Trump's position, clearing hydroxychloroquine for a rapid clinical trial to learn if it would save COVID-19 patients.The Food and Drug Administration announced an Emergency Use Authorization on March 28, 2020, for doctors to test hydroxychloroquine from the national strategic stockpile to treat COVID-19. Based on early results of studies from multiple locations, the Food & Drug Administration on June 15 revoked that permission, saying:...in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.The World Health Organization (WHO) led the multi-nation test. In an August 3, 2020, email exchange with Lead Stories, World Health Organization Communications Officer Carla Drysdale said WHO is confident in its findings that hydroxychloroquine does not improve survival rates for COVID-19 patients. She wrote:Hydroxychloroquine was found to have no impact on reducing deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in large, international randomized control trials including the WHO Solidarity Trial. These trials did not study the impact of hydroxychloroquine in mild patients or in preventing COVID-19. Their focus was on its impact on mortality in COVID-19 patients.Drysdale said WHO warns patients hydroxychloroquine can have side-effects and if used for COVID-19, should only be done so with medical supervision. She said it is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria, for which the drug was originally created.Video recycles disproven claims about COVID-19 death tallyIn addition to claiming 140,000 Americans were allowed to die preventable deaths, the video makes a somewhat contradictory claim, at 2:00 on the timecode, without offering specific states, names or numbers, that \"\"credible evidence has proven a significant number of those deaths are due to totally unrelated causes like car accidents and have nothing to do with the virus itself.\"\"Lead Stories has previously debunked similar false claims, including:- Fact Check: There Was NO Shooting Death Of A Child In Florida Counted As A COVID-19 Death- Fact Check: A Florida Motorcycle Death Is NOT Undermining The Accuracy of State's Coronavirus Death Numbers- Fact Check: The CDC Does NOT Count Pneumonia And Seasonal Flu In The COVID-19 TollLead Stories reached out via email to the One America News narrator identified as Pearson Sharp for citations, details and dates for the claims in the video. This report will be updated, as appropriate, when Sharp responds.Lead Stories has also written several articles on various claims involving hydroxychloroquine, including:- Fact Check: Dr. Fauci Did NOT Say In 2005 That Hydroxychloroquine Was Both A Cure And A Vaccine For Coronavirus- Fact Check: Hydroxychloroquine, Zinc And Zithromax Are NOT A Cure For COVID-19- Fact Check: Hydroxychloroquine Is NOT A Drug Being Held Back, And Studies ARE Underway For Vaccines That Will NOT Be Immediately Injected In People- Fact Check: No 'Deep State' Operators Trying To Ban Hydroxychloroquine\n",
      "Vaccines -> A Covid-19 vaccine “Q&A” sheet has been circulating on social media. It presents a checklist of claims about the vaccine, alongside ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers. Some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mRNA vaccines may be dangerous.The Covid-19 vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be. While side effects are common, these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within a few days.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m in“Are the MRNA vaccines experimental? Yes”While these are the first mRNA vaccines to be rolled out to the general public, the technology behind mRNA vaccines has been developed over a number of years.In the UK, two of the three approved Covid-19 vaccines , the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - use mRNA technology.Both mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would.Many vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response. These antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing.Covid-19 mRNA vaccines go one step back in the process. Once inside the body, the mRNA works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. The body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins.This means that if it is later infected, the body will be able to generate a faster and more effective immune response to the virus.“Have they been safety tested on animals? No”This is untrue. The Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals.The Associated Press reports this confusion may have arisen because Moderna and Pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests. Ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials.“Have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans? No”This depends on how you define medium or long term. The vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid-2020, so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety.“Are the effects of the vaccines reversible? No”It’s unclear what’s meant by “reversible”.All the vaccines are intended to protect people against Covid-19. It is unclear how long that protection will last, and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time.The vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these, such as pain around the injection site, fatigue or nausea, are mild and pass within a few days.The evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited. For example in the Pfizer trial, the proportion of people who experienced a serious “adverse event” after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 0.6% and among the group of people who received the placebo it was 0.5%.Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. These reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines.The Yellow Card website says: “For all COVID-19 vaccines, the overwhelming majority of reports relate to injection-site reactions (sore arm for example) and generalised symptoms such as ‘flu-like’ illness, headache, chills, fatigue (tiredness), nausea (feeling sick), fever, dizziness, weakness, aching muscles, and rapid heartbeat. Generally, these happen shortly after the vaccination and are not associated with more serious or lasting illness.”“Will the vaccines stop me getting COVID? No”All the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing Covid-19.Studies have found that people given one dose of the Pfizer vaccine have a 70% reduced risk of becoming infected, both with and without symptoms, rising to 85% after the second dose. This data comes from healthcare workers who were tested for Covid every two weeks, regardless of whether they had symptoms.Data in adults over 70 shows that both the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccines are between 60-70% effective against symptomatic disease around a month after the first dose, and 85-90% after the second dose of Pfizer (this particular study didn’t look at the effect after two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine).“Will the vaccines stop me spreading COVID? No”Evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19.The evidence suggests that one dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines significantly reduces your chances of passing on the virus to members of your household, if you do catch it.Initial research, covering over a million contacts in the UK, has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts. This protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination, and was regardless of age.“Will the vaccines allow me to stop wearing a mask? No”Current UK government guidelines still encourage vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing a mask. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a face mask in indoor settings or public transport in England ended regardless of vaccination status. Businesses, including transport operators, can still ask their employees and customers to wear face coverings.“Do the vaccines contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs)? Yes”Some of the vaccines do contain GMOs. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a virus, which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells, without replicating itself and infecting the body.“Do the Astra-Zeneka [sic] & Johnson & Johnson vaccines contain aborted human or monkey cells? Yes”Some vaccines use a virus as the active ingredient. As mentioned, for example, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine uses a virus.Viruses need cells to replicate, so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines. For example, the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs.For the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the 1970s. This cell line is called HEK-293 and we’ve written about it before.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in 1985.So both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells, rather than the original foetal cells themselves.And while the cells are used to grow the virus, they are filtered out of the vaccine, meaning neither vaccine “contain[s] aborted human...cells.”It’s unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from, but it may be a misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine is an altered version of a virus that typically infects chimpanzees. This doesn’t mean it comes from chimpanzees.“Do doctors have concerns about the mRNA vaccine’s long term effect on fertility? Yes”The Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) says that there is “no evidence” to suggest that the Covid-19 vaccines affect fertility. Similar statements have been issued by the British Fertility Association, the NHS and Public Health England.The RCOG also states that there is no biologically plausible mechanism by which the vaccine would cause fertility problems.The RCOG and the NHS recommend pregnant women get vaccinated.We’ve written more about fertility and vaccines.“Is there a risk of auto immune disease, strokes, seizures, convulsions or other side effects? Yes”As mentioned, many people may experience side effects with Covid-19 vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within a few days.Vaccine safety is continually monitored. People in the UK who suspect they have experienced a side effect due to a vaccine are encouraged to report this to the Yellow Card scheme. As we’ve said, these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not.In the US there is a similar system for reporting suspected side effects called VAERS.We’ve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects.“Have the vaccines caused any deaths or injuries? Yes”When this article was originally published, no deaths had been directly attributed to Covid-19 vaccinations. As mentioned, in the UK, deaths and side effects can be reported to the Yellow Card scheme for investigation.Since then, and as of 18 August 2021, there have been 72 deaths in the UK from a certain extremely rare type of blood clot, occurring alongside a low level of platelets (a component of the blood), following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The MHRA has concluded there is a possible link between the two and advised that people under the age of 40 should receive a different vaccine.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says: “Adverse events following the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are extremely rare and, for the vast majority of people, the benefits of preventing serious illness and death far outweigh any risks.”“Are the vaccine manufacturers liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines? No”In the UK the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out, but they have not been fully “licensed”. This means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability.However manufacturers aren’t fully protected. For example, the UK government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are “defective”.“Are there doctors and scientists recommending people NOT to take it? Yes”Some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take Covid-19 vaccines.Far more doctors, health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been found to be safe and effective.The information included in this article contains the latest evidence and official guidance available at the time it was written. This is not a substitute for medical advice. If you require specific medical advice please consult your GP or midwife.\n",
      "COVID-19 Denialism -> A video interview of conspiracy theorist David Icke, posted on Facebook, makes a number of misleading and dangerous claims about Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, gene therapy and asymptomatic cases of the virus.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inAsymptomatic transmission is realDuring the video, Mr Icke claims the transmission of Covid-19 through those with asymptomatic cases of the virus is a “hoax” and brands asymptomatic Covid-19 a “load of nonsense”.This is not accurate. There is evidence that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 has played an important part in the spread of the Covid-19. The World Health Organisation has stated: “Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people”. However, the extent that asymptomatic Covid-19 cases contribute to overall transmission has been debated.One analysis published in the Lancet in January 2021 states that asymptomatic Covid-19 patients are infectious (although may be less so than symptomatic patients, as has been suggested by other research). It concluded that “where resources permit, contact tracing should proactively seek people with asymptomatic COVID-19 because they can transmit disease and will need to be contained if a national policy objective is to minimise cases and transmission.”Other analysis has been more forthright – a meta-analysis of eight Chinese studies, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association, says that transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated in some cases to have accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 transmissions.As we have said elsewhere, other meta analysis studies (which analyse the results of several studies together) have shown asymptomatic infections make up between 17% and 20% of cases. However, there were large ranges within the studies.The founder of the World Economic Forum did not suggest Covid-19 was a conspiracy to promote climate change agendasMr Icke also claims that Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum said Covid-19 was “an opportunity for a great reset to save the world from human caused climate change” and later states that Covid-19 and climate change are “two hoaxes perpetuated by the same force”.The basis for this, he says, was a book by Mr Schwab and author Theirry Mallaret called “The Great Reset”. Since its publication in 2020 it has drawn the attention of conspiracy theorists.The Great Reset (very broadly summarised) discusses how the world’s political, business and social institutions may wish to address pre-existing geo-political concerns, such as global warming, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.In the book Mr Schwab suggests the possibility of creating “long-lasting and wider environmental changes” through changes in behaviours and new activism as society readapts to a world in which it must co-exist with Covid-19. He also provides some evidence of some of the efforts being made by big business and others to achieve this.However, Mr Schwab also states the pandemic has created significant risk that the climate change agenda could be deprioritised as nations attempt to deal with other pressures caused by the virus.Mr Schwab states that some economies may even “put aside” concerns about global warming to concentrate on their recovery following Covid-19, which may well include subsidising “fossil-fuel heavy and carbon emitting industries”.So while Mr Schwab did talk about climate change policy and action in respect of the global recovery from Covid-19, there is nothing to suggest the pandemic was engineered to promote this agenda.Covid-19 vaccines reduce transmissionMr Icke also suggests that none of the manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines are “claiming to stop transmission”.Evidence shows vaccines reduce the risk of infection for those who have been vaccinated, and the risk of people who have been vaccinated from passing on the virus.While manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines have not claimed they prevent 100% of transmission, as they do not, evidence suggests the vaccines significantly reduce the risk.Evidence from Public Health England showed that the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by more than 70% which rises to 85% after two weeks. Other studies have shown recipients of the Pfizer vaccine were 95% less likely to contract Covid-19. For the Moderna vaccine that was 94% and for AstraZeneca it was 76%.Initial research, covering over a million contacts in the UK, has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts. This protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination, and was regardless of age.We also have repeatedly written about the links between transmission of Covid-19 and vaccines.Vaccines are not gene therapyMr Icke says plainly at one point that none of the Covid-19 vaccines fulfill the definition of a vaccine but that “they are a gene therapy”. Gene therapy is a technique to treat illnesses by modifying an individuals' genes, for example by replacing a faulty gene with a healthy one.As we have stated before, some of the Covid-19 vaccines contain messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes a protein specific to a pathogen’s surface. This mRNA provides instructions to make the proteins usually found on the surface of the Covid-19 virus. This in turn prompts the body to make Covid-19 antibodies.However, introduction of mRNA into human cells does not change the DNA of the human cells and if these cells replicate, the mRNA would not be incorporated into the new cells’ genetic information.David Icke’s other claimsThere are a number of other claims within the video which we’ve already debunked including false claims that that the inventor of PCR said it couldn’t be used to detect infectious diseases, that vaccines make you infertile and that the current Covid-19 vaccines don’t fulfil the definition of what a vaccine is.Image courtesy of Tyler Merbler, licensed under CC BY 2.0\n"

      "Did George Soros, Bill Gates and the Rockefeller family create the COVID-19 virus, as a three-judge Peruvian court declared? No, that's not true: Although the exact location and origin of the virus has not been definitively identified, many virologists and other scientists studying the issue believe it likely spread from bats to humans in a live market in Wuhan, China. The judges in Peru appear to have used one of the many baseless conspiracy theories surrounding the origin of COVID-19 as a convenient excuse for not having a ruling on time in an unrelated court case.The story appeared in an article published by the 20minutos newspaper in Spain on January 11, 2021, titled, \"\"Un tribunal peruano acusa a Bill Gates, Soros y Rockefeller de crear la COVID-19\"\" (In English: \"\"A Peruvian court accuses Bill Gates, Soros and Rockefeller of creating COVID-19\"\") (archived here) which opened:Un tribunal de Perú afirmó, en una resolución basada en teorías conspirativas, que la COVID-19 fue una invención de las \"\"élites criminales a nivel mundial\"\" conformadas, según los magistrados de esta corte, por multimillonarios como George Soros, la familia Rockefeller y el empresario y cofundador de Microsoft Bill Gates.Which in English means:A Peruvian court claimed, in a resolution based on conspiracy theories, that COVID-19 was invented by \"\"worldwide criminal elites\"\" made up, according to the judges in that court, of multimillionaires like George Soros, the Rockefeller family and businessman and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates.Users on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:Un tribunal peruano acusa a Bill Gates, Soros y Rockefeller de crear la COVID-19(English: A Peruvian court accuses Bill Gates, Soros and Rockefeller of creating COVID-19)Un tribunal de Perú afirmó, en una resolución basada en teorías conspirativas, que la COVID-19 fue una invención de las \"\"élites criminales a nivel mundial\"\" conformadas, según los magistrados de esta corte, por multimillonarios como George Soros, la familia Rockefeller y el empresario y cofundador de Microsoft Bill Gates.Which in English means:A Peruvian court claimed, in a resolution based on conspiracy theories, that COVID-19 was invented by \"\"worldwide criminal elites\"\" made up, according to the judges in that court, of multimillionaires like George Soros, the Rockefeller family and businessman and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates.The three-judge appeals court in Peru cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason they did not have a ruling on a prisoner's bid for release done on time. The pandemic, they said, could not have been predicted, except by its \"\"creators in the New World Order\"\" -- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, investor and philanthropist George Soros and the Rockefeller family. The judges said in a December 21, 2020, statement cited by the Peruvian legal news service lpderecho that:... the judicial proceeding was paralyzed because of the Covid 19 pandemic, created by criminal elites who rule the world, and which paralyzed activities in nearly all the nations of the world ... This event was unforeseeable and is a justified cause that paralyzed, and will keep hindering not only judicial labors of the courts of the world, but also all the economic, social and cultural activities ... So, no world government, citizens and judges, nor the defense of the accused can maintain that this epidemic was 'foreseeable,' except to its creators in the New World Order such as Bill Gate [sic], Soros, Rockefeller, etc. who directed it and keep directing it with an outrageous secretism inside their environments and world corporations ...The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the Corona virus comes from the animal world.The CDC said on January 21, 2021:We do not know the exact source of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but we know that it originally came from an animal, likely a bat.There has been no scientific evidence that the virus was manufactured in a lab. The WHO had already determined nearly a year ago that it was highly unlikely that the virus was made in a laboratory, stating in a March 26, 2020, report:At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, all available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a manipulated or constructed virus. SARSCoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats.Furthermore, the WHO report said:All SARS-CoV-2 isolated from humans to date are closely related genetically to coronaviruses isolated from bat populations, specifically, bats from the genus Rhinolophus. SARS-CoV, the cause of the SARS outbreak in 2003, is also closely related to coronaviruses isolated from bats. These close genetic relations suggest that they all have their ecological origin in bat populations. Bats in the Rhinolophus genus are found across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. SARS-CoV-2 is not genetically related to other known coronaviruses found in farmed or domestic animals. The analysis of the virus genome sequences also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is very well adapted to human cell receptors, which enables it to invade human cells and easily infect people. All the published genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human cases are very similar, suggesting that the start of the outbreak resulted from a single point introduction in the human population around the time that the virus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China. The analyses of the published genetic sequences further suggest that the spillover from an animal source to humans happened during the last quarter of 2019.The World Health Organization has convened an international team to conduct a Global Study of the Origins of SARS-CoV-2.Like a child who hasn't finished a school assignment on time, the Peruvian judges have some explaining to do. The legal news service lpderecho reported on January 11, 2021, that top-level judicial officials in Peru announced they will start an investigation into the statement by the three judges.\n",
      "Did the CDC inflate COVID-19 death numbers by 1,600% and did it violate federal law by enacting new data collecting rules for cause-of-death reports? No, that's not true: The nation's mortality data expert told Lead Stories The Centers for Disease Control did not change its reporting rules when the COVID-19 virus outbreak began in the United States in 2020. Further, the CDC does not make laws that states must follow to report causes of death, said Robert Anderson, Chief, Mortality Statistics Branch, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The story appeared as an article published by National File on February 1, 2021 titled \"\"BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law - National File\"\" (archived here) which opened:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE.

This IPAK report lists 10 authors from a number of naturopathic and natural healing organizations.The National Center for Biotechnology Information previously debunked a claim by the group's founder that the COVID-19 virus was created in a lab.The National File article goes on to claim:The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research...asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal - Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,\"\" the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.There is no readily available evidence that the group All Concerned Citizens exists - a Google search yields no results for the organization. One post on Facebook notes that Dr. Henry Ealy is the spokesperson for the group. Ealy is the first person mentioned as the author of the study in the National File article.The National File article also claims:The (IPAK report) demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,\"\" stated All Concerned Citizens.Anderson spoke to Lead Stories via telephone on February 12, 2021 and explained that the CDC guidance for death reporting was not altered for COVID-19 deaths in 2020: \"\"I was involved in the development of the 2003 guidelines. I was involved in the development of the COVID-19 guidance. They are the same. The reason why we emphasized COVID-19 and put out a COVID-19-specific guidance was to ensure these [deaths] were being reported in the proper way.\"\"Anderson explained:There is an idea out there that if people have these pre-existing comorbidities but they die from COVID-19, then the comorbidities should be the cause of death. That's not the case. COVID-19 is something you die from. It is the underlying cause. If you have cancer or diabetes and are in a car accident, a car accident causes trauma and bleeding. It is the car accident that caused the death. The condition that initiated the chain of events that lead to death is the cause of death. Just because you have the pre-existing comorbidities doesn't mean that should be counted as the cause of death.\"\"Anderson continued, \"\"People can live for years with comorbidities. Then if something comes along and cuts their life short, that's the cause of death. Not the pre-existing comorbidities.\"\"Page 7 of the 25 page IPAK report asserts:We allege that the complete absence of the appropriate Federal Register records is evidence that the CDC knowingly and willingly violated the IQA & PRA. As a direct consequence of implementing the two documents below without OMB approval, there was significant inflation of COVID-19 case and fatality data.e) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,\"\"Anderson refuted the claim that the CDC illegally enacted new rules for death reporting. \"\"This idea that CDC didn't follow the rule making process? That's absurd. The data are collected, death certificates are governed by state laws and regulations. There is no federal law governing collecting data from states. It doesn't make any sense for CDC, NCHS to go through a rule making process and create a rule for a state law. That doesn't make any sense. We can't do that. That wouldn't be legal.\"\"The IPAK report cites :According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on August 23, 2020, \"\"For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19 , on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\"\"That corresponds to what Health.com reported in August 2020: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that only 6% of people who died of COVID-19 only have COVID-19 on their death certificate.Anderson broke down how the IPAK report authors likely came up with the \"\"1,600% increase\"\" based on the 6% percent number:They're just taking the total number of COVID-19 deaths from August 23, 2020 - 161,392 - and using 6% of that to get 9,684. They took 6% of the other and used that as the new number, that accounts for the increase from 9,684 to 161,392, which is a 1,600% increase.He continued, \"\"They're saying we're going to only count the deaths that have COVID-19 with no comorbidities. It is ridiculous to suggest that only those deaths with just COVID-19 are the COVID-19 deaths. That was debunked long ago.\"\"Lead Stories debunked the comorbidities-are-cause-of-death claim here.NewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes nationalfile.com as:A website that has repeatedly published conspiracy theories and other false information and does not disclose its agenda.According to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.

      "A viral post on Facebook has made a number of claims about the Covid-19 death rate, saying that fewer people died in the first three months of 2020 than over the same period in each of the last five years. Some readers have asked us to look into this question as well.The claim in the post is not true. The figures cover different time periods and can’t be compared.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inWhere did these numbers come from?The author of the post says they got their figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website. We’re not sure exactly when the post first appeared, but it was being shared on Facebook around 18 April, when the equivalent monthly figures for the first three months of 2020 were not yet available.The data used for the first three months of 2015-2019 describes the number of deaths registered monthly in England and Wales. Adding together the totals for January, February and March for each of these years gives the same figures that the post claims (except for 2017, when the ONS figures give a total of 153,798 instead of the 153,808 which is quoted in the post).It appears that the author used slightly different figures to come up with their total for the first three months of 2020, using the weekly figures for deaths in the first 12 weeks of the year. These show that “a total of 138,913 deaths were registered in England and Wales between 28 December 2019 and 20 March 2020 (year to date)”. This period of 12 weeks starts four days earlier, and ends 11 days earlier, than the data it’s compared to for 2015-2019. It therefore misses an entire week of deaths that occurred during the pandemic.The real figureWhen the ONS did eventually publish comparable monthly data for the first three months of 2020, it showed that 150,082 people had died (as opposed to the Facebook post’s 138,913). This is more than the number who died in the first quarters of 2016 and 2019, but less than the totals in 2015, 2017 and 2018. It is around 2,000 deaths below the five-year average, not almost 5,000, as the post claims. It’s also around 14,500 below the figure for the first three months of 2018.The effect of Covid-19The post also claims that the ONS had registered “4,122 deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. So, according to the ONS, COVID-19 has been responsible for just 2.9% of 138,913 deaths in 2020.”This calculation is a mistake that we think comes from mixing up the data from two different periods. In the 12-week period when 138,913 people died, the ONS actually counted just 103 death registrations mentioning Covid-19, not 4,122. The figure of 4,122 Covid-19 deaths seems to come from the data after 14 weeks.The true percentage of death certificates that mentioned Covid-19 in the first 12 weeks of the year was just 0.07%. However, the disease has been responsible for a much higher share of deaths since then. In the 16th week of 2020, for example, which ended on 17 April, 39% of all death certificates mentioned Covid-19.After 17 weeks of 2020, 229,294 deaths had been registered in England and Wales, which is more than the total up to the same point in any of the previous five years.\n",
      "“The death rate in Andalucía almost halved following the introduction of their Vitamin D policy. Tragically, here in the UK our death rate more than doubled over the same period, despite us having 5x the vaccinations.”“This is a very important study on vitamin D and Covid-19. Its findings are incredibly clear. An 80% reduction in need for ICU and a 60% reduction in deaths [...] the study demonstrates that the clear relationship between vitamin D and Covid mortality is causal.”Vitamin D has been talked about as a potential treatment to prevent Covid-19, or reduce its severity, since the outbreak of the pandemic. This has resurfaced over the past few weeks with the discussion of data from a Spanish public health approach, and a new trial from Spain which looked at vitamin D as a treatment for Covid-19.Whilst many studies show an association between low vitamin D levels and higher rates or severity of Covid-19, it has been difficult to show low vitamin D to be the cause of higher rates or worse infection. There are a number of interconnected social and physiological factors which make determining low vitamin D levels as the sole cause of increased or worsened infection complicated, and studies often show conflicting results.Whilst having vitamin D within a normal range is certainly part of overall good health, which could help the body cope with Covid-19, further randomised control trials are in progress. A study run by Queen Mary University of London, for example, has been designed to offer robust evidence and give a “definitive answer to the question of whether vitamin D offers protection against COVID-19”.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inWhat has been claimed about Vitamin D?At the start of February, Conservative MP David Davis tweeted that the death rate in Andalucía, Spain, had “almost halved following the introduction of their vitamin D policy”.He also shared a data table and graph showing a reduction in deaths from Covid-19 in Andalucía between November and December 2020, after the supposed introduction of vitamin D supplementation in the region in November.Mr. Davis’ office shared his sources with us. Although the figures we reached were slightly different, data taken from the Andalucía Ministry of Health and Families website for the same period does show a reduction in deaths between November and December 2020 from 194 deaths per million people to 85 deaths per million.However, deaths then increased again in January to 176 deaths per million of the population. Whilst there is recognition that residents in Andalucía have been given vitamin D supplementation, there is no further detail published on this policy, or evidence of formal trial results.There is no clear evidence that this reduction in deaths in November and December is solely due to the introduction of vitamin D supplementation, and it doesn’t explain the upturn in deaths in January. Other potential causes for the reduction in deaths could be the coronavirus restrictions introduced in Andalucía in November.Mr. Davis has also tweeted the results of a study from Barcelona, which has not yet been peer reviewed (meaning it is what is known as a pre print), which looked at the impact of vitamin D as a treatment for Covid-19.He said the findings of the study are “incredibly clear” in showing an 80% reduction in the need for intensive care treatment and a 60% reduction in death, and added: “Furthermore, since the study demonstrates that the clear relationship between vitamin D and Covid mortality is causal, the UK government should increase the dose and availability of free vitamin D to all the vulnerable groups.”Whilst the results from this trial sound encouraging, and build on the findings of a pilot study held in Cordoba, it is important to recognise some of the limitations of this data. The pre print does not include information on how they decided which participants to give vitamin D to, and which not to. There could therefore be large differences in the background health and demographics between the group that received vitamin D, and the group that did not. There was also evidence that some trial protocols were not followed. For example 50 patients who were part of the group who were not supposed to receive vitamin D treatment, were given vitamin D on admission to intensive care.This study has since been removed from the Lancet website, pending ‘investigation’. Professor Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow said the trial “falls well short of a well conducted randomised trial. Whilst many wish to believe vitamin D is the cure to Covid-19 or an exciting treatment, this ‘trial’ cannot allow any such inference”.Another recent study showed no impact of treatment with vitamin D on Covid-19 mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, or length of hospital stay.There are several randomised control trials underway, due to be published in 2021. These will give more evidence, to help to answer some of the questions around vitamin D and Covid-19.Why the interest in Vitamin D?Vitamin D helps to regulate calcium absorption, and bone development. Most of our vitamin D is absorbed from interactions between substances in our skin and sunlight, with a small amount absorbed from dietary intake.Studies have suggested that vitamin D serves an important immune function, and it has been implicated in preventing a range of conditions including particular cancers, cardiovascular disease, and severe infections. There has been growing interest in the benefit of vitamin D in prevention and treatment of respiratory infections in particular. A 2020 meta analysis for example, concluded that taking vitamin D supplements reduced the risk of respiratory infection, although only for people aged between one and 16-years-old. It added that the “relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires investigation.”In addition to this evolving research, it was recognised that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected countries with known vitamin D deficiency, and people who are at higher risk of low vitamin D.Why the debate?Some politicians and medical professionals feel that there is a body of evidence, through trials such as these from Spain, Israel and America which show an association between low vitamin D and Covid-19 infection, or show reduced severity of infection with vitamin D treatment. They argue that given the context of a pandemic, and as vitamin D is relatively safe, and cheap, it should be used as part of the toolkit against Covid-19.Others, however, feel that the evidence base reveals a more complex picture. Some studies, such as those mentioned above, do show an association and potential benefit. There are also studies however, such as this randomised control trial from Brazil, or this study from the UK, which show conflicting results. The Brazil study, for example, shows no impact from treatment with vitamin D in hospitalised patients, whilst the UK study showed that the association between low vitamin D and Covid-19 may be due to other factors. However, it is also important to note that the Brazil study has been criticised, and faces calls for a retraction, with concerns raised about how reliable and ethical the research was.Many of the risk factors that cause somebody to be low in vitamin D are also risk factors for Covid-19, including being an older age, from a BAME background or having certain chronic diseases. Therefore it is hard to tease out if it is low vitamin D, or factors causing the low vitamin D that make someone more vulnerable to Covid-19 infections. Whilst it is clear that there is an association between low vitamin D and Covid-19, studies have struggled to definitely remove the impact of other factors, and have often shown conflicting results.Another complicating factor is that, as part of a normal inflammatory response, vitamin D levels fall. Therefore whilst vitamin D levels will often be low in someone who is very unwell in hospital, this may be a temporary response to their period of illness, rather than a reflection of the person having generally low vitamin D at the time of becoming unwell. Caution therefore needs to be exercised when vitamin D levels are measured in relation to Covid-19 infection.Should you take vitamin D?As we’ve discussed, there is ongoing debate about the role of vitamin D in Covid-19.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded in December 2020 that there was insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D as a treatment for Covid-19, or to alter guidance around vitamin D supplementation because of Covid-19.The current guidelines from NICE state that everyone over the age of four should: “consider taking a supplement containing 10 micrograms (400 units) of vitamin D daily between October and early March, when people in the UK do not make enough vitamin D from sunlight.” For some clinical groups, such as children age 1-4 years old (and some babies under 1 year old), people with darker skin or little exposure to sunshine, they recommend taking vitamin D supplementation all year round. There are some health conditions that mean that people should not take vitamin D supplements.Some medics have suggested that a higher daily dose of vitamin D should be recommended, which would bring the UK in line with EU and US guidance.NICE has commented that its guidance will be updated as new evidence becomes available.\n",
      "No, Ivermectin & Hydroxychloroquine Do Not Treat COVID-19Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were only approved to be used under clinical trials by the World Health OrganisationTwo videos shared hundreds of times on Facebook feature a Kenyan doctor alleging that two drugs -- ivermectin on its own --and then hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc and azithromycin -- are effective in treating Covid-19. But the claims are false: there is no scientific evidence that either medication can help treat the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.In a video posted in English on March 17, 2021, Kenyan doctor Stephen Kimotho Karanja claims that two sets of medication can help treat Covid-19: the anti-parasite drug ivermectin on the one hand, and a mix of the anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine, with zinc and azithromycin on the other.He makes the same claim in his native Kikuyu language in a second video posted on Facebook on March 24, 2021.\"\"Covid-19 can be treated. The following drugs are the ones that may be used because they are available, they are cheap, and they can be found in Africa, in Kenya, and in other countries at any time. The backbone is a medicine called ivermectin, normally used for worms, but it is very important in the treatment of Covid-19. The other medicine is hydroxychloroquine, so-called HCQ. When used together with zinc 50 milligrams, it weaponises the zinc, which destroys the Covid-19 virus,\"\" he says in the videos.The post introduces Karanja as chairman of the Catholic Doctors Association, which released a statement in March calling Covid-19 vaccines \"\"unnecessary\"\" and \"\"unsafe\"\".AFP Fact Check debunked a number of false or misleading claims made in the statement here.Ivermectin Studies 'Inconclusive'Scientists working hard to find treatments and vaccines to help treat and prevent Covid-19, which has killed more than 2.8 million people worldwide since it emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019.Ivermectin is a medication used to fight various parasitic infections. In the US, ivermectin tablets are prescribed to treat parasitic worms, and creams and lotions are used for conditions like head lice and rosacea. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivermectin to treat or prevent Covid-19.Ivermectin is used to treat parasitic infections (AFP/ Luis Robayo)The FDA has cautioned against \"\"a growing interest\"\" in ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19.\"\"The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses,\"\" it said on March 5, 2021.The WHO advised that ivermectin was only to be used to treat Covid-19 in clinical trials, according to updated guidelines published on March 31, 2021.\"\"There is no evidence to support the use of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin is approved for human use to treat parasitic worms but has not yet been approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug in treating COVID-19,\"\" the UN health agency told AFP Fact Check.Nairobi-based epidemiologist Emanuel Okunga also said that more trials are needed before drawing conclusions about ivermectin's efficacy.\"\"To be sure about the effectiveness of ivermectin, we need to conduct larger clinical trials, which we don't have at the moment\"\" he told AFP Fact Check.Dozens of ivermectin trials around the world are listed on this US database.AFP Fact Check has previously debunked several claims about ivermectin drug, including here, here and here.Hydroxychloroquine 'little to no impact'Hydroxychloroquine made headlines last year when public figures including former US president Donald Trump and controversial French doctor Didier Raoult falsely touted the drug as a \"\"cure\"\" for Covid-19, see here and here.Karanja is not the first doctor to suggest mixing hydroxychloroquine with other drugs to treat Covid-19. In July 2020, a video of US-based doctor Stella Immanuel went viral when she claimed that she had successfully treated more than 350 Covid-19 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin.Screenshot of the video featuring Dr Stella Immanuel, taken on July 28, 2020Trump helped spread the footage of Immanuel by sharing it on his now permanently-suspended Twitter account. AFP Fact Check debunked Immanuel's remarks here.No medical studies support the claim that hydroxychloroquine, either on its own or mixed with zinc and azithromycin, cures Covid-19.The WHO strongly advises against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity.\"\"Evidence from these studies shows that hydroxychloroquine has little to no impact on illness, hospitalisation, or death. There is also no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing or treating COVID-19 when mixed with zinc, azithromycin or any other medicine,\"\" the WHO told AFP Fact Check .Last June, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorisation that had allowed hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile -- the US national repository of antibiotics, vaccines, chemical antidotes and other critical medical supplies -- to be used to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients.And in August 2020, South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases also cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. The agency makes it clear in its Covid-19 guidelines that \"\"antibiotics do not treat viral infections\"\".Antibiotics don't treat virusesAzithromycin, marketed as Zithromax, is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, infections of the nose and throat such as sinus infection (sinusitis), skin infections, and strep throat. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses like the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.In December 2020, British scientists concluded, based on preliminary data analysis from the UK's RECOVERY Trial, that azithromycin had \"\"been found to have no meaningful clinical benefit for patients hospitalized with severe forms of the disease\"\".Unproven zinc claimZinc is a nutrient that can help the immune system fight off infection. It also assists the body in making protein and DNA, and it is important in infant and childhood development.AFP Fact Check previously debunked claims about \"\"cures\"\" for Covid-19 such as zinc, vitamin C and vitamin D, including here. Zinc has been widely touted as a supplement to prevent and cure Covid-19. While there is some evidence zinc helps the body fight colds, the American National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine says \"\"scientists don't know if it helps ease Covid-19 symptoms\"\".Dr Okunga also noted that taking zinc does not prevent or treat Covid-19.\"\"So far, studies show that zinc is not effective in treating Covid-19, and self-prescription with zinc is dangerous,\"\" he said.The US National Institutes of Health warns against taking high doses of zinc to prevent Covid-19, pointing to a lack of evidence and potential side effects, including irreversible neurological conditions from long-term use of supplements.Do you always want to share the authentic news with your friends?\n",
      "The StatementA post shared by a New Zealand Facebook user claims cold-storage vaccines are not legitimate and are aimed at genetic manipulation.“Any vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn’t a vaccine. It’s a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material,” the post reads.“Don’t let them fool you. This is genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale. Shut it down.”The post, which is from a November 15 tweet by The Disruptive Physician, Doc Evenhouse, has been shared on Facebook multiple times (here, here, here and here).The AnalysisThe post makes two claims about vaccines that are incorrect. Many vaccines are routinely stored at sub-zero temperatures and the idea that cold-storage COVID-19 vaccines are a transfection agent that cause “genetic manipulation” is biologically impossible, experts say.While the Facebook post does not mention a specific vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine created by Pfizer and BioNTech must be stored between -70 to -80C. That vaccine is currently being rolled out in the United Kingdom and in the United States.A chart by the American Academy of Pediatrics lists several vaccines which require sub-zero temperatures for storage. Other vaccines such as that for Ebola virus, was stored at -80C, according to the World Health Organization.Regarding the post’s claims, Dr Nikki Turner, director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre at the University of Auckland told AAP FactCheck in an email: “The simple answer is this (post) is completely incorrect.”Vaccinologist Dr Helen Petousis-Harris, a member of the New Zealand Vaccine Safety Expert Advisory Group and director of the University of Auckland’s Vaccine Datalink and Research Group, also rejected the claims made about the COVID-19 vaccine.“(It) is a very peculiar statement. … It is very much a vaccine in that it is a biological agent used to induce immunity to a disease in those to whom it is administered,” Dr Petousis-Harris told AAP FactCheck in an email.The Pfizer vaccine and another by Moderna, use messenger RNA (mRNA), a molecule that puts DNA instructions into action. Instead of putting a weak or inactive germ into the body as many vaccines do, the mRNA vaccines cause the body to make a protein that triggers an immune response, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).These vaccines need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures to keep the delicate mRNA material intact, according to Margaret Liu, a vaccine researcher who chairs the board of the International Society for Vaccines. Liu told National Public Radio (NPR) in the US that mRNA is “really easily destroyed, and that’s because there are many, many enzymes that will just break it apart”.A spokesman for the Auckland Immunisation Advisory Centre agreed and explained to AAP FactCheck that it is “the mRNA technology (e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine that requires the colder storage and transportation. This temperature is required to preserve the mRNA material and prevent it from breaking down.”As of December 18, the New Zealand government has made arrangements to purchase four COVID-19 vaccines for use – Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Novavax and AstraZeneca. The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine New Zealand agreed to buy, with a total of 1.5 million doses ordered. It will be transported and stored at -70C.The post also claims that the vaccines are “a transfection agent,” meant to cause global genetic manipulation. But this misrepresents how mRNA vaccines work.“Transfection” means introducing nucleic acids – DNA or RNA – into a cell, according to the biotechnology company Sigma-Aldrich. The process is outlined in a video here.Dr Petousis-Harris told AAP Factcheck that RNA vaccines “are not transfection agents aimed at genetic manipulation”.“There is no ability of RNA vaccines to, in any way, modify or manipulate our genomes,” she said.“One reason is because the RNA cannot gain access to our genome, another is that it does not have the capability to integrate into it. Therefore this is a biological impossibility.”A fact sheet by the CDC also states that “(mRNA vaccines) do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.”The post also claims that the vaccine is “kept alive so it can infect your cells,” however the CDC notes that “mRNA vaccines do not contain a live virus and do not carry a risk of causing disease” in a vaccinated person.“mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA.”Similar claims have been previously debunked here, here and here.The VerdictAccording to medical experts, the post’s claims about the COVID-19 vaccine are false. Many vaccines require cold storage and the reason freezing temperatures are required for the COVID-19 vaccine is to keep delicate mRNA material intact. Experts told AAP FactCheck that mRNA vaccines do not manipulate a person’s genome.False – Content that has no basis in fact.* AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.

      "Were Texas and other states ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization to fraudulently increase by 15-fold the tally of COVID-19 cases? No, that's not true. The CDC gathers data based on the non-binding suggestions of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Aside from that, Texas Department of State Health Services data show no 15-fold increase in reported cases in Collin County, which used as the basis for the claim.The claim originated in a video and article (archived here) published by The Alex Jones Show on June 29, 2020, on the banned.video channel under the title \"\"Breaking: States Ordered To Fraudulently Inflate COVID-19 Cases 15 Times Actual Rate.\"\" The video opened with a clip from what Jones dated as a May 18, 2020, public meeting of Collin County Commissioners Court in which officials explained changes in the way \"\"probable\"\" cases of COVID-19 are counted. Jones came out of the clip saying:This is complete proof that the covid19 testing regime and the definitions they semantically use from the NIH and CDC are frauds. This has been confirmed. If one person tests positive for COVID 19, fifteen people in the computer model are then said to have it.This is what the video looked like at the time of writing:The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists did send states new COVID-19 case-counting guidelines in May that directed public health officials to help chart the spread of COVID-19 by listing both confirmed cases and probable cases. That change reflected what field epidemiologists had noted, that people were spreading the contagion before they knew they were carriers and disease fighters needed an earlier warning.Rather than wait for confirmed cases to show up, the epidemiologists urged public health officials to include in the count anyone for whom COVID-19 was the most likely explanation for symptoms such as high fever, respiratory difficulty and taste disorders. That way, CDC mapping would give public health officials advance notice where the contagion was moving, allowing time to warn the public to avoid events and venues where contagion spreads.But the guidelines are non-binding and The Washington Post reported June 8, 2020, that less than half of all U.S. states had adopted the new tally, including large states such as California, Florida and New York.Texas did adopt the new reporting scheme, but there has been no 15-fold rise in the number of cases there, according to these Texas data graphed by The New York Times, showing the July 3 total and the total at the time the new reporting rules were put into effect. The change over that period has been from 960 cases to 7,158, a seven-fold increase during a period when CDC data show the U.S. case total has doubled. Searching U.S. case data and state data, Lead Stories was not able to locate any instance of the 15-fold increase in reported cases referred to in Jones' claim.Here's how the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists explained their proposal to start counting probable cases along with confirmed cases:Epidemiological reports from the field are demonstrating a growing importance of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections from two lines of evidence: the serial interval of COVID-19 appears to be close to or shorter than its median incubation period and clusters linked to presymptomatic and asymptomatic index cases...Here are the rules for counting suspected or probable cases, adopted April 5, 2020, and circulated for state approval:In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as \"\"probable\"\" or \"\"presumed.\"\" In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID-19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID-19 should be conducted whenever possible.Clinical Criteria: At least two of the following symptoms:- fever (measured or subjective),- chills,- rigors,- myalgia,- headache,- sore throat,- new olfactory and taste disorder(s)ORAt least one of the following symptoms:- cough,- shortness of breath, or,- difficulty breathingORSevere respiratory illness with at least one of the following:- Clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, OR- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).ANDNo alternative more likely diagnosis.For this report, Lead Stories reached out to the office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Department of State Health Services, Collin County Public Health District, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to the epidemiologist who drafted the new guidelines for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

      "Virus Origin and bioweapon theory -> We’ve been asked to look into claims that the Covid-19 virus hasn’t been isolated, doesn’t fulfil “Koch’s postulates”, and that this means PCR diagnosis tests aren’t working.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inIsolating a virusFirstly it is incorrect to say that the virus that causes Covid-19 has not been isolated.Isolating a virus means taking a pure sample of a virus from an infected being so it can be studied. There are numerous reports of the virus being isolated by teams around the world.“SARS-CoV2 has been sampled millions of times over from infected people, including those originally found to be infected in China,” Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist and Associate Professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, told Full Fact.Koch’s postulatesIt’s also incorrect to say that the virus that causes Covid-19 would need to meet Koch’s postulates, primarily because Koch’s postulates weren’t written for viruses.Koch’s postulates were a set of rules outlined by scientist Robert Koch in 1890 to decide whether a bacteria causes a disease. The original four criteria are:“1. The microorganism must be found in the diseased animal, and not found in healthy animals.“2. The microorganism must be extracted and isolated from the diseased animal and subsequently grown in culture.“3. The microorganism must cause disease when introduced to a healthy experimental animal.“4. The microorganism must be extracted from the diseased experimental animal and demonstrated to be the same microorganism that was originally isolated from the first diseased animal.”As noted by many, these criteria were written before the discovery of viruses, so fail to include them in their consideration of what a disease is.Dr Griffin outlined other shortcomings in Koch’s rules.“The first postulate in particular is void as even at Koch’s time (which he later admitted)” he told us. “Folks knew that you could catch e.g. Cholera without necessarily becoming unwell - asymptomatic infection is a massive issue for these ideas (first and third postulates), as is the arrival of molecular biology!”Another of Koch’s postulates was that bacteria must be able to be isolated from the host. Viruses, unlike bacteria, require host cells in which to replicate, so also cannot be isolated in the same way Koch defined with bacteria, which according to Dr Griffin, required “culture as in a flask of media, so viruses don’t fit this idea.”So simply put, Koch’s postulates are not a good measure of what causes disease in 2020.PCR testsWe also know that PCR tests are identifying the virus that causes Covid-19 and working well.As we have written before, PCR tests used in Covid-19 testing are extremely sensitive and specific at detecting Covid-19 and do not confuse other coronaviruses, such as ones that cause the common cold, for Covid-19.“The PCR test is incredibly stringent and specific, requires two separate reactions to be positive ... and EVERY test is also sequenced, so we know it is SARS-CoV2 and not another virus,” said Dr Griffin.So in summary, Covid-19 has been isolated, Koch’s postulates don’t have to universally apply for something to cause disease, and tests to identify the Covid-19 virus do work.\n",

      "Incidence, Mortality and 'Casedemic' -> Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been shared on social media, which apparently shows the number of deaths from various non-Covid causes was far lower in December 2020 than in previous Decembers.This has been used to suggest that deaths which are now being classed as Covid-19 deaths are actually just miscategorised deaths from other causes.But this is not the case. In fact, the data from the ONS was just produced incorrectly. There were falls in the number deaths from some non-Covid conditions in December 2020, but nothing like what the tables initially suggested.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inWhat was wrong with the data?The data, originally published on 18 January, was meant to show the number of deaths from the leading causes, averaged over the previous five Decembers (2015-2019), but there were some clear indications that there was something wrong.It appeared as if the “five-year average” figures for the number of deaths from the listed causes had been added together, but not actually been divided by five in order to create an average.Firstly, the data claimed to show that there were 114,399 deaths in England from the leading nine causes of death, averaged over the previous five Decembers. But other data within the release showed that the highest number of deaths from all causes in any single December over the previous five years was just 44,286 (in 2019).Also, while the five-year average number of deaths from these leading causes were all far higher than the levels in 2020, the rates of death per 100,000 people all appeared to be more in line with the levels in 2020.After Full Fact, and others including Italian fact checkers Facta, contacted the ONS about the error, it confirmed this was the mistake that had been made and issued new tables.What does the correct data show?The new, correct, data shows that the number of deaths in December 2020 from some non-Covid causes were slightly lower than the previous five-year average.The biggest falls were deaths from influenza and pneumonia, and “chronic lower respiratory diseases.”As we’ve written before, the UK is seeing a very mild flu season, in part due to the fact that flu vaccinations are at their highest ever level and steps the country is taking to reduce the spread of Covid-19 may also be reducing the transmission of influenza.\n",
      "Prevention (Face Mask, Vitamin D, etc.) -> FACT CHECK: No, Drinking Magnesium Citrate Cannot Prevent Or Cure CoronavirusA post shared on Facebook more than 1,100 times claims drinking magnesium citrate can “kill” the new coronavirus and stop it from spreading.Verdict: FalseThere is no scientific evidence that drinking magnesium citrate can prevent or cure the new coronavirus. The misuse of such laxative products can cause serious negative health effects.Fact Check:The internet has become replete with social media posts about alleged preventatives and cures for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This particular post claims consuming magnesium citrate can “kill” the new virus and stop it from spreading. (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill Coronavirus?)“As a medical professional I want to help as many people as possible in these hard times. If by any chance you feel sick or that you may of come in contact with Covid19,” reads the viral post. “1 bottle of this will kill the virus and stop it from spreading. IF MUST LEAVE YOUR HOUSE. DRINK A FULL BOTTLE PRIOR TO LEAVING !!! It will give you a few hours of a barrier.”Magnesium citrate is a laxative used to treat constipation on a short-term basis and to empty the bowels before colonoscopies. The misuse of such laxative products can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and bleeding, among other dangerous health effects, according to Brown University.There is no scientific evidence that using magnesium citrate and other laxatives can prevent or cure the new coronavirus. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend magnesium citrate for such use on their respective websites. Experts have also warned the public that taking supplements and home remedies that have not been approved for preventing or treating COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration can cause serious negative health effects, according to The New York Times.The CDC recommends thorough hand washing, social distancing and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, among other preventative measures, to reduce the risk of infection.\n",
      "Treatment (Ivermectim, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, etc) -> Have multiple studies shown that countries treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine suffer fewer deaths than those like the U.S. where its use is restricted? No, that's not true: The claim was made without citing any such studies. Lead Stories has not found peer-reviewed clinical studies that declare hydroxychloroquine is a cure, and the World Health Organization has declared the opposite putting a stop to a multi-national test of the drug when French and British researchers found it does not cut the mortality rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and may contribute to heart problems.The claim appeared in a video posted to YouTube on August 1, 2020, titled, \"\"Studies show countries using hydroxychloroquine have far fewer COVID-19 deaths\"\" (archived here), which opened:While the media continues to slam the use of hydroxychloroquine, numerous studies have revealed countries that used the drug are doing much better than those that haven't. One America's Pearson Sharp has the details.Click below to watch the video on YouTube:This One America News video makes several claims that either cannot be substantiated or have been rejected by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control.'Numerous studies' claimed -- but no citations or titles providedThe video refers to \"\"numerous studies,\"\" but does not provide the author nor title of any specific study.Although Dr. David Nazarian of Los Angeles, California, is not interviewed on camera and the time and place of his comments is not provided by the narrator, the One America News video says (at time code 1:00) that Nazarian says patients taking hydroxychloroquine are doing better than those who aren't.Board certified in internal medicine, Nazarian operates My Concierge MD, Executive Health in Los Angeles, California. On his website, he says he has worked as an emergency room doctor, as a doctor providing medical service on movie production sites and as a hospitalist. As a medical student, his website says, he served a one-month rotation in 2008 in epidemiology, the study of how diseases spread. He lists one scholarly publication, a 2004 journal article about stroke medication. Lead Stories reached out to Nazarian by phone and email on August 3, 2020, to check the research and statements attributed to him. This story will be updated, if appropriate, when Nazarian replies.Describing Nazarian as having conducted a study, the One America News narrator says:He points to countries in Africa where hydroxychloroquine is taken widely and prophylactically to protect against diseases like malaria. Incidentally, these countries have some of the lowest levels of coronavirus infections and deaths anywhere in the world.Here's the video segment containing the reference to Nazarian's research and analysis:Later in the video, the One America News narrator says \"\"doctors say\"\" hydroxychloroquine could cure between 70% to 90% of the patients diagnosed with the disease and that a Yale University School of Public Health professor of epidemiology, Dr. Harvey Risch, agrees that it could easily save 100,000 Americans.Risch, who also holds a Ph.D., specializes in cancer research and has, according to Yale's website, published hundreds of scholarly articles, told Lead Stories in an August 3, 2020, email exchange that One America's video \"\"is somewhat approximate of what I said, at the end of a Laura Ingraham episode.\"\" He appeared on the July 21 episode of \"\"The Ingraham Angle,\"\" on which he said the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine for outpatients could save thousands of lives. He told Lead Stories:What I did say is that if HCQ became immediately available and into use, some 50,000-100,000 lives could be saved.Though the One America News report does not refer to it, Risch told Lead Stories he has recently written a letter accepted for publication in the American Journal of Epidemiology taking issue with research into hydroxychloroquine. In it, he criticizes the study by which hydroxychloroquine was ruled out as a treatment for COVID-19 and calls attention to other clinical studies that say hydroxychloroquine will save COVID-19 patients. He discloses in his letter that he has done consulting work for two of the 50 manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline, but not on those drugs and not in the last two years and that he has not planned future work with those pharmaceutical companies. Such disclosures are not unusual in medical journals, as much research is underwritten by corporate sponsors.The basis for claims that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19Contradicting current findings of the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization, Risch told Lead Stories \"\"it is also completely possible that the medication cuts the mortality by two-thirds\"\" although he concedes a claim like his, based on a review of someone else's clinical studies, is hard to assess.In 150 days there would be 100,000 lives saved in this scenario. That's 5 months. There are some assumptions in this of course, but all within reasonableness. The one-half-to-two-thirds is in the range of the various studies showing positive benefit in risk reduction for hospitalization or mortality of high-risk outpatients, the people most likely to die if they are not treated.Risch told Lead Stories he does not treat patients with COVID-19, but bases his estimates on clinical studies he has reviewed, plus his contention that the World Health Organization and FDA decisions were based on weak evidence. \"\"The whole system was wrong, to allow fraudulent papers to be uncritically peer-reviewed and vetted by the journal editors-in-chief.\"\" Risch is Editor of the American Journal of Cancer.FDA and WHO findings about hydroxychloroquineIn declaring hydroxychloroquine a life-saving COVID-19 drug, the One America News video narrator adds, at 2:38 on the timecode: \"\"That means that radical leftist governors and politicians in Washington have allowed nearly 140,000 Americans to die just to prove President Trump wrong.\"\"But, Washington-based agencies originally agreed with President Trump's position, clearing hydroxychloroquine for a rapid clinical trial to learn if it would save COVID-19 patients.The Food and Drug Administration announced an Emergency Use Authorization on March 28, 2020, for doctors to test hydroxychloroquine from the national strategic stockpile to treat COVID-19. Based on early results of studies from multiple locations, the Food & Drug Administration on June 15 revoked that permission, saying:...in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.The World Health Organization (WHO) led the multi-nation test. In an August 3, 2020, email exchange with Lead Stories, World Health Organization Communications Officer Carla Drysdale said WHO is confident in its findings that hydroxychloroquine does not improve survival rates for COVID-19 patients. She wrote:Hydroxychloroquine was found to have no impact on reducing deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in large, international randomized control trials including the WHO Solidarity Trial. These trials did not study the impact of hydroxychloroquine in mild patients or in preventing COVID-19. Their focus was on its impact on mortality in COVID-19 patients.Drysdale said WHO warns patients hydroxychloroquine can have side-effects and if used for COVID-19, should only be done so with medical supervision. She said it is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria, for which the drug was originally created.Video recycles disproven claims about COVID-19 death tallyIn addition to claiming 140,000 Americans were allowed to die preventable deaths, the video makes a somewhat contradictory claim, at 2:00 on the timecode, without offering specific states, names or numbers, that \"\"credible evidence has proven a significant number of those deaths are due to totally unrelated causes like car accidents and have nothing to do with the virus itself.\"\"Lead Stories has previously debunked similar false claims, including:- Fact Check: There Was NO Shooting Death Of A Child In Florida Counted As A COVID-19 Death- Fact Check: A Florida Motorcycle Death Is NOT Undermining The Accuracy of State's Coronavirus Death Numbers- Fact Check: The CDC Does NOT Count Pneumonia And Seasonal Flu In The COVID-19 TollLead Stories reached out via email to the One America News narrator identified as Pearson Sharp for citations, details and dates for the claims in the video. This report will be updated, as appropriate, when Sharp responds.Lead Stories has also written several articles on various claims involving hydroxychloroquine, including:- Fact Check: Dr. Fauci Did NOT Say In 2005 That Hydroxychloroquine Was Both A Cure And A Vaccine For Coronavirus- Fact Check: Hydroxychloroquine, Zinc And Zithromax Are NOT A Cure For COVID-19- Fact Check: Hydroxychloroquine Is NOT A Drug Being Held Back, And Studies ARE Underway For Vaccines That Will NOT Be Immediately Injected In People- Fact Check: No 'Deep State' Operators Trying To Ban Hydroxychloroquine\n",
      "Vaccines -> FACT CHECK: Does Donald Trump ‘Own Half Of Moderna’?A viral Instagram post claims former President Donald Trump “owns half of Moderna.”View this post on InstagramVerdict: FalseU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for Moderna and Trump’s most recent financial disclosure show he does not own 50 percent of Moderna. A spokesperson for Moderna also refuted the claim.Fact Check:Moderna Inc., a publicly-traded pharmaceutical company, developed a COVID-19 vaccine that received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults in December 2020. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines have also been respectively authorized for emergency use by the FDA, according to the agency’s website.An image alleges in an Instagram post that Trump “owns half of Moderna,” adding, “Let that sink in Qtards.” The claim, however, doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. (RELATED: Does The Moderna Vaccine Contain Luciferin?)Publicly available financial information about Moderna shows no indication that Trump holds a 50-percent stake in the company. The company’s most recent DEF-14A, an SEC filing required to be sent whenever a shareholder vote is needed, does not list Trump among its executive officers, directors and director nominees or among the beneficial owners of more than 5 percent of Moderna stock. Moderna’s most recent 10-K filing, an annual report that provides a comprehensive overview of the company’s financials, briefly discusses some actions the Trump administration took that affected the company but otherwise contains nothing that would suggest Trump holds a 50-percent ownership stake.It appears that no single entity owns half of Moderna. The company’s largest stockholder is the investment management company Ballie Gifford & Co, which has just over an 11-percent stake, according to Moderna’s most recent DEF-14A and CNN Business.There is also no evidence of Trump holding a significant ownership stake in Moderna in his most recent financial disclosure from January 2021. While much of his wealth is, according to Forbes, in real estate, the financial disclosure shows that included in his other holdings are three family trusts that are themselves invested in various funds.Check Your Fact didn’t find Moderna listed among the top 10 equity holdings for any of the funds identified in Trump’s most recent financial disclosure. At least two of the funds appear to have Moderna stock in their portfolios, but those holdings make up less than 1 percent of the funds’ assets.

      "COVID-19 Denialism -> Were Texas and other states ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization to fraudulently increase by 15-fold the tally of COVID-19 cases? No, that's not true. The CDC gathers data based on the non-binding suggestions of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Aside from that, Texas Department of State Health Services data show no 15-fold increase in reported cases in Collin County, which used as the basis for the claim.The claim originated in a video and article (archived here) published by The Alex Jones Show on June 29, 2020, on the banned.video channel under the title \"\"Breaking: States Ordered To Fraudulently Inflate COVID-19 Cases 15 Times Actual Rate.\"\" The video opened with a clip from what Jones dated as a May 18, 2020, public meeting of Collin County Commissioners Court in which officials explained changes in the way \"\"probable\"\" cases of COVID-19 are counted. Jones came out of the clip saying:This is complete proof that the covid19 testing regime and the definitions they semantically use from the NIH and CDC are frauds. This has been confirmed. If one person tests positive for COVID 19, fifteen people in the computer model are then said to have it.This is what the video looked like at the time of writing:The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists did send states new COVID-19 case-counting guidelines in May that directed public health officials to help chart the spread of COVID-19 by listing both confirmed cases and probable cases. That change reflected what field epidemiologists had noted, that people were spreading the contagion before they knew they were carriers and disease fighters needed an earlier warning.Rather than wait for confirmed cases to show up, the epidemiologists urged public health officials to include in the count anyone for whom COVID-19 was the most likely explanation for symptoms such as high fever, respiratory difficulty and taste disorders. That way, CDC mapping would give public health officials advance notice where the contagion was moving, allowing time to warn the public to avoid events and venues where contagion spreads.But the guidelines are non-binding and The Washington Post reported June 8, 2020, that less than half of all U.S. states had adopted the new tally, including large states such as California, Florida and New York.Texas did adopt the new reporting scheme, but there has been no 15-fold rise in the number of cases there, according to these Texas data graphed by The New York Times, showing the July 3 total and the total at the time the new reporting rules were put into effect. The change over that period has been from 960 cases to 7,158, a seven-fold increase during a period when CDC data show the U.S. case total has doubled. Searching U.S. case data and state data, Lead Stories was not able to locate any instance of the 15-fold increase in reported cases referred to in Jones' claim.Here's how the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists explained their proposal to start counting probable cases along with confirmed cases:Epidemiological reports from the field are demonstrating a growing importance of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections from two lines of evidence: the serial interval of COVID-19 appears to be close to or shorter than its median incubation period and clusters linked to presymptomatic and asymptomatic index cases...Here are the rules for counting suspected or probable cases, adopted April 5, 2020, and circulated for state approval:In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as \"\"probable\"\" or \"\"presumed.\"\" In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID-19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID-19 should be conducted whenever possible.Clinical Criteria: At least two of the following symptoms:- fever (measured or subjective),- chills,- rigors,- myalgia,- headache,- sore throat,- new olfactory and taste disorder(s)ORAt least one of the following symptoms:- cough,- shortness of breath, or,- difficulty breathingORSevere respiratory illness with at least one of the following:- Clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, OR- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).ANDNo alternative more likely diagnosis.For this report, Lead Stories reached out to the office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Department of State Health Services, Collin County Public Health District, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to the epidemiologist who drafted the new guidelines for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. This story will be updated as needed when they reply.\n"

      "example: False: This simulation video does not show Japan’s treated water from Fukushima ‘polluting half of the Pacific ocean in 57 days’On April 11, 2021, a journalist at state-controlled broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN), Shen Shiwei, claimed in a tweet that Japan’s plan to release wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear reactors would pollute half of the Pacific ocean within 57 days.The post contained a simulation video from the German Institute Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR), which supposedly shows how the contaminated nuclear wastewater will spread. Chinese ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Deng Xijun, repeated the claim in his tweet on the following day.The video clip included in the two tweets has been viewed over 400,000 times and each post has been retweeted more than 700 times.A similar video and claim were also posted on Douyin by Chinanews.com, saying the model stimulation from GEOMAR is terrifying. The Douyin video got more than 3,000 shares and 377,000 likes.However, the video is nine years old. It has nothing to do with Japan’s plan that was announced last month to release treated radioactive water containing tritium, possibly starting in 2023.The clip has also been manipulated. It is cropped to make the covered area in the ocean appear bigger than in the original video, presumably to match the claim.In fact, the 2012 original simulation showed the findings of a study titled “Model simulations on the long-term dispersal of Cs-137 released into the Pacific Ocean off Fukushima,” authored by Erik Behrens, Franziska U Schwarzkopf, Joke F Lübbecke, and Claus W Böning at GEOMAR.It demonstrates a projected spread of radioactive cesium-137 in the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the subsequent nuclear crisis at Fukushima.In the original video, the 57th day looks like the screen capture below.Annie Lab measured the color-coded area by overlaying it on a map through an online tool called Georeferencer.Our estimation indicates the area reached by the tracer cloud covered approximately 2,235,115.25 square kilometers, which is less than two percent of the Pacific Ocean’s total area of 155 million square kilometers.Annie Lab also plotted the colored area on the Pacific Ocean on Google Earth to visualize its comparative size (as seen below).The tracer does not cover half of the Pacific Ocean. It occupies less than two percent of the entire ocean.The manipulated video in the tweets in question cropped the original clip to remove the frame of reference on the map, the scale for radiation isotope concentration and the timescale of isotope dispersion.It also omitted the slower movement at the end of the original and accelerated the speed of the tracer, which made it appear to spread faster.Some dramatic background music was also added to replace the voice-over in the original video that described the rate of the spread of cesium.In it the scientists explained that the simulation showed how the peak concentration will reach the North American coast in five to six years and by that time, it has already been diluted.Japan’s announcement of the plan to release the treated radioactive water from the ruined Fukushima nuclear power plant was immediately denounced by neighboring countries such as South Korea and China.Annie Lab can only confirm that the video used in the tweets in question has been manipulated. It does not show what they claim. We cannot determine the impact of the planned operation on the environment.\n",

      "example: What was claimedThere were no Covid-19 deaths in Ireland in August.Our verdictIncorrect. There were 14 confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Ireland in August.There were no Covid-19 deaths in Ireland in August.Incorrect. There were 14 confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Ireland in August.There were 700 deaths from cancer in Ireland in August.We don’t know these figures yet as it is too soon after the fact. The figure for cancer seems realistic from past trends, as there were around 830 deaths caused by cancer in Ireland per month in Q1 of 2020.There were 70 deaths from alcohol in Ireland in August.We could find no source for this figure. A 2013 average of 88 alcohol-related deaths a month in Ireland includes a number of different factors, such as the coroner mentioning alcohol dependency, certain alcohol-related diseases, and if they were an alcoholic.There were 32 deaths from suicide in Ireland in August.It’s too soon to know this figure as only a coroner can officially rule a death as a suicide, but this figure is realistic looking at past data.A post on Facebook comparing the number of deaths caused by Covid-19, cancer, alcohol and suicide in Ireland in August has been shared over 2,000 times. The post gets a lot wrong, mainly that no-one died of Covid-19 in that time, when 14 people did.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailThe post claims that there were no Covid-19 deaths in August in Ireland. This is incorrect—there were 14 confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Ireland between 1 August and 31 August.This includes deaths both in hospitals and community settings. Thejournal.ie have written more about how deaths are counted in Ireland here.Although governments are providing much more detailed information around Covid-19 deaths because of the pandemic, we do not generally get official data for the number of deaths from other causes this soon after the fact, either in Ireland or the UK.For example, Ireland’s Central Statistics Office has only published death statistics for the first quarter of 2020.In that period there were 2,483 deaths from malignant neoplasms (cancer). This works out to about 830 a month, making the claim in the post that 700 people died of cancer in August a realistic figure, although as yet unproven.Alcohol itself is not an official cause of death category, and we weren’t able to find a source for the 70 figure claimed in the post.The charity Alcohol Action Ireland claims that 88 deaths every month in Ireland are “directly attributable to alcohol”. This figure seems to come from 2013, when there were 1,055 alcohol related-deaths, or an average of 88 a month, according to Ireland’s National Drug-Related Deaths Index.We have not looked in detail at this figure, but it includes deaths where alcohol was named as a reason for death by the coroner, where it was recorded on the death certificate that the person was an alcoholic, had specific alcohol-related diseases, had a recorded history of treatment for alcohol abuse, and some other cases. This means this figure may well double count some of the other types of death mentioned in the post.In Ireland, thejournal.ie fact checked similar viral claims, that 33 people had died by suicide in a single month (or week) in Ireland. It quoted a coroner as saying the claim was: “speculation at most and hearsay at worst.”It concluded that although that figure wasn’t impossible, there was no evidence to prove it was the case, as it was too soon for deaths that recent to have been ruled as suicide. Looking at data for previous years, it found there were an average of 10 per week, which would make the figure in the post feasible.The Samaritans’ helpline is available at all hours and can be contacted free on 116 123 in the UK and Ireland, or you can email jo@samaritans.org.This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as partly false because the post is a mixture of true and false or unproven claims.Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.\n",

      "example: Facebook posts falsely report 'arrest' of discredited US researcher who featured in 'Plandemic' videoMultiple Facebook posts shared in February 2021 claim police have detained discredited US researcher Judy Mikovits for \"\"discovering evidence that deadly retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines\"\". This is false: Mikovits has not been arrested in 2021. She was arrested and briefly jailed in 2011 for unlawfully taking data from her former employer, court documents show. The charges against her were dropped in 2012, according to US media reports. A 2009 study she co-authored on retroviruses did not focus on vaccines and was retracted. There are no credible reports that Mikovits has been detained in 2021.The claims were shared in this Facebook post on February 1, 2021.It features a photo of Mikovits, who has previously falsely claimed that flu vaccines contain coronaviruses and that Covid-19 jabs could kill 50 million Americans. She appeared in the viral 2020 documentary “Plandemic”, which was widely discredited for making false claims about Covid-19.“Thanks to Anthony Fauci, she was arrested without charges and placed on a 5 year gag order, destroying her reputation, career, and personal life,” the post reads.“Molecular biologist Dr. Judy A. Mikovits was thrown in jail after discovering evidence that deadly retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines given to humans.”Identical posts have been shared on Facebook around the world during the pandemic, including Canada, the US and the Philippines.The claim is false. There are no credible reports that Mikovits has been detained in 2021.In 2011, she was arrested and briefly jailed in California. According to documents from a California district court, however, she was arrested on charges of theft from the laboratory that performed the ill-fated study, not for research on retroviruses.\"\"Plaintiff Judy Anne Mikovits... (was terminated) as a researcher with the Whittemore-Peterson Institute (WPI), located in Reno, Nevada, and (subsequently arrested on allegations) that she stole propriety information from the research facility. On November 18, 2011, plaintiff was arrested Ventura County,\"\" this court filing reads.She was earlier charged in Reno with \"\"possession of stolen property\"\" and \"\"unlawful taking of computer data, equipment, supplies, or other computer related property\"\".The same details surrounding her arrest were reported by the New York Times, Science magazine, ABC News, and the Chicago Tribune.The charges against her were eventually dropped, the New York Times reported on June 14, 2012.Discredited researchThe claim that Mikovits was jailed for her allegedly discovering evidence that “deadly retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines” is also misleading.Keyword searches on Google Scholar did not yield any reliable academic publication indicating she made such a discovery.Mikovits’s discredited study on retroviruses found that the retrovirus XMRV was frequently present in the blood of chronic fatigue sufferers, without establishing a causal link.The findings of the research were published in the academic journal Science in 2009 and aroused great interest at the time as it provided a possible explanation for the origins of chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating disease that had long baffled scientists.The study did not find that “deadly retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines”.The paper was retracted in 2011. Academic journal Science cited sample contamination and failure by multiple laboratories to replicate its findings.“Multiple laboratories, including those of the original authors, have failed to reliably detect (the retrovirus) or other… related viruses in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients,” the retraction read. “In addition, there is evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments in the report.”\n",

      "example: FACT CHECK: Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi Violating COVID-19 Safety Guidelines For Social GatheringsAn image shared on Facebook claims to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi violating coronavirus safety guidelines by attending a party and not wearing a mask.Verdict: FalseThe image was taken in January 2020, over a week before the U.S. confirmed its first COVID-19 case.Fact Check:Under phase two coronavirus restrictions put in place by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, indoor gatherings are currently limited to 10 people, and restaurants are limited to operating at 25 percent capacity indoors. Masks must be worn inside public establishments except while eating or drinking, according to the guidelines.A post on Facebook shares an image of Pelosi gathered around several people. No one appears to be wearing a mask or practicing social distancing. The photo’s caption reads, “Ladies and Gentlemen here’s your speaker of the house enjoying a party after she tells you you can’t have social gatherings.”Through a reverse image search, however, Check Your Fact found that the image is actually from the Jan. 7 opening of Maialino Mare, a restaurant in D.C. The image was taken by Washingtonian Magazine food editor Anna Spiegel and posted on her Twitter account that same day.Nancy Pelosi at Danny Meyer’s Maialino Mare opening in Navy Yard. pic.twitter.com/OMkVtxeEEk— Anna Spiegel (@AnnaSpiegs) January 8, 2020“Nancy Pelosi at Danny Meyer’s Maialino Mare opening in Navy Yard,” Spiegel tweeted along with the photo. (RELATED: Was Nancy Pelosi Pictured With The Manson Family In 1969?)Pelosi was not in violation of any COVID-19 restrictions in D.C. in the image. D.C. reported its first positive COVID-19 case on March 7, two months after the photo of Pelosi was taken, ABC 7 reported. Bowser then declared a public health emergency on March 11 and issued a stay at home order on March 30, according to DCist.The novel coronavirus first emerged in China late last year, according to the New York Times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t confirm the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. until Jan. 21, over a week after Pelosi attended the restaurant opening.Pelosi’s office previously addressed claims that she violated COVID-19 safety guidelines in San Francisco in September while receiving a haircut indoors, CNN reported.\n",

      "example: Guinea has not ordered the arrest of all Chinese nationalsA video of a man rebuking foreigners has been viewed thousands of times on social media alongside a claim that the Guinean government has ordered the arrest of all Chinese nationals in the country while awaiting the safe return of Guineans from China. However, the video was actually recorded last year before the pandemic, and the Guinean government has not issued any such order.In the video, a visibly angry French-speaking man is heard rebuking foreigners and demanding that they respect Guineans. Behind him, a group of Asian men and women look on, while cheers and clapping can be heard off-camera.“This can’t go on. Either they respect the laws of this country, or they get out of here,” the man says in French.On April 18, 2020, a Kenyan blogger with more than one million followers tweeted the video and wrote: “Guinea has allegedly arrested Chinese nationals in the country and has asked Beijing to assure the safe return of her citizens from China before they are released. #ChineseInKenyaMustGo”.The video was also posted with the same claim to Instagram on April 17, 2020. It has since been viewed more than 2,000 times and used in an article by a Kenyan website.The same claim was also posted on Facebook here, here and here.This video appeared online after Africans living in southern China report they have been victims of arbitrary evictions and discrimination during the pandemic, as covered by AFP here. In mid-April, the African Union expressed “extreme concern” about the situation and called on Beijing to take action.An old videoThe man in the video is not a government official, as some posts suggested, but the leader of a trade union.AFP was able to identify the man by searching for the keywords (in French) “Chinois” (Chinese) and “Guinée” (Guinea) on YouTube. This led us to another version of the same video, below, where the description identifies the man as a Guinean union member going by the name “Mara.”Further keyword searches using “Mara” and “syndicaliste” (French for unionist) led to numerous photos and articles about Aboubacar Sidiki Mara, the secretary-general of the General Union of Workers of Guinea (UGTG), who is the man seen in the video.Mara is a prominent union figure in Guinea. In May 2018, he was charged with “incitement to revolt” and given six months in jail, with a four-month suspended sentence.AFP contacted Mara, who said that the video was filmed last year before the start of the pandemic near Boffa, a town about 200 kilometres north of the capital, Conakry.“It was a reaction that I had when a Chinese person attacked a Guinean person in the Boffa port. I was present on the scene, and I asked the workers to chase the Chinese out of the region,” he said, adding that the matter was later settled amicably.No arrest orderContrary to the claim being shared alongside the video, there is no record of the Guinean government ordering the arrest of Chinese nationals residing in the west African nation.On April 14, 2020, Guinean Minister of Foreign Affairs Mamadi Touré held a cordial meeting with Huang Wei, the Chinese ambassador to Guinea, where he expressed his “deep concern about the differential treatment and the stigmatization which the Africans were undergoing” in China’s province of Guangdong, according to a statement published on the ministry’s official Facebook page.According to this statement, the Chinese ambassador said that China attached “great importance to this situation” and that “the Chinese central government has given firm instructions to the localities in order to improve the mechanisms, methods and conditions of confinement”.In a statement published on April 20, 2020, the Chinese embassy in Guinea denied any arrests of its citizens had taken place.“Recently, certain online media made noise about articles and videos on 'the arrest of Chinese nationals in Guinea by the Guinean government'. The embassy of China in Guinea attaches great importance to this matter,” the statement said. “Following verification, we have found that these are pure and simple lies. We indignantly protest what is apparent defamation that aims to attack the friendship between China and Guinea and between China and Africa.”\n",

Ayanda Capital Ltd was the only bidder. Its Chief Operating Officer is quoted as saying that the contract was “successfully fulfilled.”While it is undisputed that the PPE was delivered, it was subsequently revealed that the masks were deemed by the Department of Health and Social Care as not suitable for use in the NHS. It is unclear whether they were used elsewhere.The second relates to a series of contracts awarded to Uniserve Ltd, amounting to £186 million. Uniserve Ltd was the only bidder for all five contracts.The company regularly publishes updates on its deliveries of PPE. We asked the company as to the status of PPE deliveries related to those contracts and will update this piece if we receive a response.Concern has been raised about how the government procured PPE and other services during the pandemic. There have been reports of PPE being delayed or unusable.It’s possible that some PPE contracts have not been fulfilled, but there is no evidence we’ve seen that all of the contracts, if any, listed in this Facebook post remain unfulfilled.Update 11 August 2020We have updated this piece with more information about the contract with Ayanda.This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here.

For context, always refer to the full article.At a glance:- Claim: The tally of active COVID-19 cases being done by the Department of Health (DOH) is manipulated by doctors.- Rating: FALSE- The facts: Doctors have no way of manipulating the COVID-19 tally, since the number of those who test positive come from laboratories certified by the DOH and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine using RT-PCR tests. Since March 30, positive rapid antibody tests in the “NCR Plus” region have also been included in the national count.- Why we fact-checked this: Facebook page “A DUMB Adam Betlog” posted a video with this claim, and the video has garnered over 43,000 reactions, 13,000 comments, and 18,000 shares as of writing.Complete details:A video posted on April 9 by Facebook page “A DUMB Adam Betlog” falsely claimed that doctors had been manipulating data to convert non-COVID-19 cases into active COVID-19 cases in the national tally.In the video, physical therapist Ron Samaniego reiterated previous claims he posted on his former Facebook page, “Bantayan Network by Dr. Ron,” which has since been taken down. In a mix of English and Filipino, Samaniego said, “The matter is, the exact fact is, the figures being released by the DOH aren’t real because the statistics are being manipulated by doctors converting non-COVID cases into COVID.”The Facebook page “A DUMB Adam Betlog” has over 11,400 followers and as of writing, and the video has garnered over 43,000 reactions, 13,000 comments and 18,000 shares. Similar claims have been made by Samaniego or more commonly known as “Dr. Ron,” since March, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.This claim is false.Doctors have no way of manipulating the data. According to the DOH, confirmed cases are those tested positive by a DOH-RITM-certified lab. In the national tally of COVID-19 cases, the DOH has been using the results of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests since 2020. RT-PCR tests are the more reliable option for determining the presence of the virus, at the expense of being less affordable than the rapid antibody tests and yielding a longer time for processing results at approximately 24 to 48 hours.On March 30, the DOH announced the inclusion of positive rapid antibody tests in the “NCR Plus” region of Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite in the national count. Rapid antibody tests are used in these “outbreak areas” where, according to the DOH, the RT-PCR tests may not be able to keep up with the spread of the virus.The Philippines also conducts “risk-based testing,” wherein local government units do house-to-house visits to identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19, subject them to RT-PCR testing, and isolate immediately if found positive.Swabs collected from RT-PCR tests at COVID-19 testing centers set up by the DOH and the RITM – the Philippines’ national reference laboratory for infectious and tropical diseases – are monitored, screened, and validated according to a process that spans days. Even if the sample from the swab tests positive, it is still subject to a confirmatory test before the results are released. The released results are encoded and sent to the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit that then forwards them to hospitals, and are collated in the national tally.On April 4, the DOH published a graphic on their official Facebook page debunking Samaniego’s other false claims. Samaniego is also not part of the Philippine Physical Therapy Association Incorporated, and on April 6 the organization released a statement against his videos containing false information and circulating on social media.As of April 19, the Philippines has over 141,375 active cases and the number of deaths has reached 16,000. – Sofia Guanzon/Rappler.comMore fact checks related to COVID-19:- FALSE: Ivermectin approved as COVID-19 cure in the Philippines- FALSE: COVID-19 pandemic is over, vaccine unnecessary- FALSE: Vitamin D can reduce COVID-19 deaths by 60%- FALSE: COVID-19 vaccines are ‘barcodes for life’- FALSE: Duque, Domingo face jail time for delayed Ivermectin approval- FALSE: Media did not report on March 23 COVID-19 case tallySofia Guanzon is a Rappler intern.

      "example: What was claimedYou cannot catch Covid-19 person to person.Our verdictThis is incorrect. Like other coronaviruses, Covid-19 is spread via respiratory droplets from an infected person to an uninfected person.You cannot catch Covid-19 person to person.This is incorrect. Like other coronaviruses, Covid-19 is spread via respiratory droplets from an infected person to an uninfected person.You cannot catch Covid-19 from touching surfaces.Incorrect. Respiratory droplets can land on surfaces and the virus in these droplets have been shown to remain viable for up to 72 hours on some surfaces.Viruses are dead material expelled from healing cells. Everyone has thousands of viruses inside their body.There is debate about whether viruses are technically alive. The human body does contain a number of viruses that don’t do harm. Covid-19 is caused by a virus that is potentially very harmful though.Masks decrease oxygen intake, increase carbon dioxide intake, increase toxin intake, increase stress levels which directly impacts the immune system in a negative way making us more susceptible to illness.Fabric and medical face masks should not affect breathing and the NHS says they are safe for anyone over the age of three who can manage them correctly. Certain types of masks called respirators can affect gas exchange, but can still be safely worn for several hours in a row in healthcare environments. There’s no evidence masks harm the immune system.A graphic on Facebook has made a number of claims about how Covid-19 spreads. It says:“You can not catch Covid-19 from person to person.You can not catch Covid-19 from touching surfaces.Viruses are dead material expelled from healing cells.Everyone has thousands of viruses inside their body.”Covid-19 definitely does spread person to person and via surfaces. Covid-19 is caused by a virus and is potentially dangerous, although it’s true that humans have plenty of harmless viruses in their bodies.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailThe virus that causes Covid-19, called SARS-CoV-2, does spread from person to person, through respiratory droplets released when an infected person sneezes, coughs, and talks. Close contact with an infected person is how the virus spreads.We have evidence this is the case. Other coronaviruses that infect humans, such as SARS (of which there was an outbreak in 2002) and the common cold, also spread in this way.Social distancing measures which reduce the number of person-to-person interactions have been proven to slow the spread of the virus.Covid-19 also spreads via surfaces. In general, other human coronaviruses (which we’ve had longer to study) survive on objects for up to five days. Studies into SARS-CoV-2 have shown it can survive for between 8 and 72 hours on a surface depending on the material and environment.Just touching a surface that is contaminated with the virus is not enough to become infected—the virus enters the body through membranes present in the nose, mouth, or eyes. The problem is that we touch these parts of ourselves all the time without noticing, which is why it’s so important that you wash your hands with soap and water often, especially outside of your own home.It’s unclear exactly what the graphic means when it claims that viruses are “dead material leaving healing cells”.There is some debate amongst scientists as to whether viruses are technically alive or not, because they need a host cell to replicate and can’t do so themselves. Some argue this means that they are not alive as they can’t reproduce unaided, but others disagree, saying that even though genetically they are very simple, they are still able to evolve.When viruses replicate in host cells, they take over the cell’s mechanics to reproduce, and then leave. The host cell can’t really be said to be healing when that happens, even though it may not have died. Some cells do respond to viral infection by dying.It’s true that humans contain a number of viruses that don’t harm us, or are protecting the human body against bacteria. Many of these are bacteriophages—a type of virus that infects bacteria. This is not the same as being infected with a virus that can cause a potentially dangerous disease, like Covid-19.The text of the Facebook post also claims that masks decrease oxygen intake, increase carbon dioxide intake, increase toxin intake, and increase stress levels which negatively impacts the immune system.The kind of face masks normally used by members of the public do not pose a threat to most people. We could not find any evidence that cloth face coverings and medical (sometimes called surgical) face masks reduce oxygen levels or increase carbon dioxide levels in the body.The UK government says face coverings should not be worn by children under three, or those “who may find it difficult to manage them correctly”, for example “primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions”.Asthma UK says that for some people with asthma, wearing a face covering could “make it feel harder to breathe” and “so if [they] are finding it hard, then don’t wear one”.The post we’re checking here could be referring to a specific type of mask, called an N95 respirator, which is used in healthcare settings in the US. These are also approved for use in the UK and the equivalent mask usually used here is called the FFP2. These types of masks can be worn for several hours in a row, but some research has shown that they can affect gas exchange.It’s true that face masks of all types can make some people feel claustrophobic. There’s no evidence that masks weaken the immune system though.Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.\n",

The viral visuals can be seen from 0:51 seconds in the two-minute YouTube video.The caption along with the video uploaded by user Musafir Sujon read: ‘Real cyclone seen by Sujon’ and in the comments section, he claimed that the video is from Bangladesh.It is pertinent to note that The Quint’s WebQoof team has not been able to independently verify the location of the video.Here’s a comparison between viral visuals and the one uploaded on YouTube in 2016.With help of the aforementioned information, it can be established that the viral video in question is an old one and unrelated to Cyclone Yaas.WHAT HAPPENED IN WEST BENGAL?On Tuesday, 25 May, Mamata Banerjee, while addressing a press conference said that the tornado in the state lasted for nearly one and a half minute and destroyed as many as 40 houses.\"\"I have spoken to all the district magistrates about Cyclone Yaas. I will stay in Nabanna (the state secretariat) tonight. I will monitor the situation closely,\"\" she added.Causing extensive damage, Cyclone Yaas made its landfall at Balasore in Odisha at 9:15 am on Wednesday, 26 May, after intensifying into a ‘very severe’ cyclonic storm on Tuesday.The low-lying areas and coastal towns of north Odisha and neighbouring West Bengal were severely hit by the storm with a speed of 130-140 kmph. The cyclone completed the landfall process around 1 pm, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

      "example: The spread of novel coronavirus, which was first declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March has since then become a target of misinformation and conspiracy theories alike.In one such instance, several users on social media are claiming that the 16th century French astrologer Nostradamus predicted the virus in his book ‘Les Propheties’ (The Prophecies). However, after proper checks and verification, we have found that there is no truth to these claims.THE CLAIMAccording to the claim being circulated on the internet, French philosopher Nostradamus in his book, ‘Les Propheties’ (The Prophecies) wrote: “There will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (corona) who will come from the east (China) and will spread a plague (virus)in the darkness of night, on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy, and ruin the world. (sic)”WHAT WE FOUND‘Les Propheties’ is a collection of prophecies by French physician Nostradamus. One of his most famous works, it is a collection of poems and quatrains.A Quatrain is a type of stanza/a poem consisting of four lines. The text attributed to Nostradamus in the virus message didn’t qualify to be a quatrain and raised several red flags about its veracity.Further, Stephane Gerson, Professor of French, French Studies, and History at New York University, told Reuters that this text “does not come from Nostradamus’ ‘Prophecies’, ” nor from other prognostications made by him.We followed it up with a Google keyword search using the terms “Nostradamus twin year prophecy” and found no results.The Reuters report further quoted Professor Gerson as saying, “There is nothing surprising about the reemergence of such false Nostradamian prophecies in the wake of a disaster. The same thing has happened for over 400 years: invented or altered predictions, endowed with the aura of Nostradamus, surface, again and again, part of an economy of forgery, mass media circulation, and yearnings for order and design each time an unforeseen event threatens our material well-being and our conceptual frameworks.”Evidently, a false claim saying that Nostradamus predicted COVID-19 is being shared to spread panic among the people.(You can read all our coronavirus related fact-checked stories here.)(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

This is why I say that the media should improve its knowledge.\"\"Thakur refrained to comment further on this issue, stating that the matter is sub judice.Fact CheckFollowing Thakur's speech from January 27, the Election Commission served a show-cause notice to him, stating that, \"\"By making the aforesaid statements which have the potential of disturbing communal harmony and aggravating the existing differences between social and religious communities, you have violated the above said provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act, 1951.\"\"Thakur responded by claiming he never said \"\"Goli maaro saalo ko (shoot them)\"\", and that he only said the first half of the slogan \"\"Desh ke gaddaron ko (to the traitors of the country)\"\". By this statement, Thakur insinuated that it was the crowd who had raised the slogan and that he could not be held accountable for it.However, multiple footage of the event paint a different picture. In one of the videos published by Indian Express Online, Thakur can be seen very lucidly leading the crowd in chanting the inflammatory slogan. While it is indeed the crowd in front of him that says \"\"Goli maaro saalo ko\"\", he can be seen engaging the crowd to chant even louder.At one point during the chanting, Thakur can be heard saying, \"\"The sound should reach until the back. Girirajji (Union Minister Giriraj Singh) should be able to hear it,\"\" following which he starts leading the chant again. All this while, Thakur seems clearly aware of the slogans being raised by the crowd, as he is seen encouraging them throughout the sloganeering.Eventually, the ECI found Thakur's speech to be in violation of the MCC and Representation of the People Act, 1951, and ordered his removal from the list of star-campaigners for the BJP ahead of the Delhi Elections. In a notification, the ECI found that Thakur, along with BJP leader Parvesh Verma had \"\"made undesirable and objectionable statement which has the tone and tenor to aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred between different religious communities, and this violated the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act, 1951.\"\"Not A New SloganThe notorious slogan is by no means recent. Using relevant keyword searches, BOOM traced the earliest instance of this slogan being raised to February 2016, when members of the ABVP led a march in Delhi while raising the slogan in question. This march was carried out to protest against the anti-national slogans that were allegedly raised in the Jawaharlal Nehru University earlier that month.On December 20, 2019, BJP leader Kapil Mishra led a pro-Citizenship Amendment Act march where the same slogan was raised again.The same slogans were raised on January 5, 2020, when students at JNU were attacked by a group of masked people.A #JNU teacher who was speaking to the media is heckled and interrupted by ABVP, BJP & RSS goons outside JNU main gate with \"\"Desh ke gaddaro ko, goli maro salo ko\"\" slogans.— Sanjay Lakhwad (@SanjayUkroond) January 6, 2020Sickening how teachers are openly being insulted.#JNUattack #ResignAmitShah#अखिल_भारतीय_गुंडा_परिषद pic.twitter.com/fbZXOzgX7uDo you always want to share the authentic news with your friends?\n",

      "example: Nueces County saw 52 positive COVID-19 tests among children aged under 1 year, and 33 positive tests among children aged between 1 and 2 years, making a total of 85 positive tests among children under 2 years old.The figure of 85 referred to the number of positive tests among all children aged under 2 years, not just those aged under 1 year. A misunderstanding led the Nueces County Public Health Director to inadvertently misrepresent the true figure, and the Nueces County Judge, and later CNN, repeated that error.In July 2020, readers asked us to verify reports that a single county in Texas had seen 85 babies test positive for COVID-19 coronavirus disease. On July 18, CNN published an article with the headline \"\"85 Infants Under Age 1 Have Tested Positive for Coronavirus in One Texas County Since March.\"\" The article reported that:\"\"Eighty-five babies under age 1 have tested positive for coronavirus in one Texas county since mid-March. And local officials are imploring residents to help stop its spread as the state becomes one of the newest hotspots [...]. In Texas' Nueces County, where Corpus Christi is located, the number of new coronavirus cases skyrocketed in July after a flattening trend. The virus has infected dozens of babies and local officials are urging people to wear masks and practice social distancing.\"\"'We currently have 85 babies under the age of one year in Nueces County that have all tested positive for Covid-19,\"\" said Annette Rodriguez, director of public health for Corpus Christi Nueces County on Friday. 'These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us stop the spread of this disease.'\"\"Rodriguez made the remarks during a remote briefing as part of the county's July 17 COVID-19 update and in the context of urging residents to resume and continue taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the interest of thoroughness, the relevant remarks are quoted in full, and can be watched, below:\"\"I've been reviewing our statistics. We currently have 85 babies, under the age of one, here in Nueces County, that have all tested positive for COVID-19. These babies have not even had their first birthday yet. Please help us to stop the spread of this disease. Stay social [sic] distanced from others. Stay protected -- wear a mask when in public, and for everyone else, please do your best to stay home.\"\"AnalysisOn July 18, Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales issued a statement in which she clarified that the figure presented by Rodriguez referred to all positive tests among children aged under 1 year since March, rather than the number of currently active cases among children of that age:\"\"On Friday, July 17, during a press conference, a spokesperson mentioned that 85 infants under the age of one had tested positive for coronavirus. This number reflects the cumulative total of positive tests for infants under the age of 1 since the beginning of testing in mid-March, which has resulted in 8,171 positive test results.\"\"For context, the spokesperson was using that statistic to illustrate that no one is naturally immune to this virus. While the elderly and those with existing medical conditions are at greater risk of illness and death, anyone can get the virus, from the elderly to infants, and without regard to race, gender, or economic status. The number was used to illustrate this point. However, without this context, stating this number during our press conference led many to believe that we had a sudden surge in infants under the age of one testing positive. We have NOT had a sudden surge of 85 infants testing positive.\"\"That clarification provided the basis for CNN's claim, in its headline, that \"\"85 infants under age 1\"\" had tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County.However, the clarifying statement itself contained an inaccurate presentation of the true figures. On July 18, Yahoo! News published an article with the headline \"\"85 Children Under Age 2 Tested Positive for Coronavirus in 1 Texas County, as U.S. Sets New Record.\"\" The article reported that:\"\"Rodriguez initially said at a meeting Friday that a review of coronavirus statistics showed that 85 infants have tested positive. She clarified this on Saturday to say that total also includes children between the ages of 1 and 2 years old. The numbers are taken from testing that started on March 21, 2020.\"\"According to Yahoo! News, that figure included 52 positive tests among children aged under 1 year.We couldn't find any public clarification by Rodriguez on Saturday, July 18, so we contacted her directly. Speaking by phone, Rodriguez confirmed for Snopes that the figures presented by Yahoo! News were indeed accurate -- the county had seen 52 positive COVID-19 tests among children aged under 12 months, and 33 among children aged between 12 and 24 months.Rodriguez said a misunderstanding had taken place when she requested the number of COVID-19 diagnoses among 1-year-olds. Health district employees had counted cases involving, for example, 16- and 18-month-old children because they were not yet 2 years old, when Rodriguez was in fact looking only for the number of cases among children aged under 1 year.According to the press release published by Canales on July 18, the total number of positive tests in Nueces County was 8,171. Assuming that figure is accurate, this would mean the 52 children under 1 year old made up 0.64 percent of all positive tests in the county. According to the Texas Department of Health Services' COVID-19 dashboard, there had been 28,606 confirmed cases across the entire state as of July 21. Of those, 127 (or 0.44 percent) involved children aged under 1.Although we're comparing two slightly different measures (positive tests versus confirmed cases, based on completed investigations by local and regional health departments), the available data does suggest that children under 12 months have tested positive for COVID-19 at a slightly higher rate in Nueces County than in the state of Texas as a whole.ConclusionCNN's headline inaccurately claimed that \"\"85 infants under age 1\"\" had tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County.\"\" That figure was, in fact, 52. Although the figure of 85 was taken from remarks made by the director of the local health district and a subsequent statement by the County Judge, it was nonetheless inaccurate. Taking into account these factors, we're issuing a rating of \"\"Mostly False.\"\"\n",

      "example: A message falsely claiming to be a list of people ready to donate plasma in India is being shared over social media amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found that this is actually an old list of blood donors, which is unrelated to coronavirus and dates back to at least 2015.CLAIMThe list, which contains names, blood groups and phone numbers of roughly 64 so-called plasma donors is being shared on platforms as a response to people asking for plasma donations or simply as awareness notices amid the pandemic.Plasma therapy, which uses the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients, is one of the investigational therapies being tried in India as part of the effort to fight the virus. Recovered COVID patients' immune systems may have created antibodies that fight the novel coronavirus. These antibodies build up and can be found in plasma, the liquid part of blood.We found that the message was being shared on Twitter and Facebook by various people. One person shared it claiming it was a list for people in Mumbai, while one person replying to this Facebook post claimed it was a list of people in Delhi-NCR.WHAT WE FOUNDOn running several keyword searches, we found that the same list, with minor variations in some names, has been shared on Facebook since at least December 2015. We found the same post dated 5 December 2015 on a page called The New Face of Society.Since then, it has been shared on a Facebook page called BLOOD DONOR S on 9 September, 2016 and by a Facebook user on 17 September, 2019.We also found that it was posted on 21 October 2016 with some variations on a blog called I Love Trichy, on a website called Telangana Journalists three years ago with the note that it was for Hyderabad and on Medium.com on 10 November 2017 as a list of blood donors in Chennai.While many of the numbers on the list were non-functional or did not exist, The Quint was able to get in touch with four people on the list who confirmed that they were blood donors based in Chennai. Two of them said that they had also donated blood in recent months.V Mohan, one of the people named in the list, told The Quint that this was a group of blood donors based in Chennai, which had been made two or three years ago and said that it had nothing to do with plasma donation in the COVID context.“This list has been wrongly forwarded as a plasma donor list. So many of the volunteers have been getting calls about plasma donation that some have even had to change their numbers. Please don’t forward as plasma donors, we are all normal blood donors.”V MohanTherefore, it is clear that an old list of blood donors is being circulated as that of plasma donors in context of the coronavirus pandemic.(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

      "example: What was claimedDandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours.Our verdictLaboratory studies using cancer cells have shown that dandelion root extract has anti-cancer effects, but this has not been proven in humans.Dandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours.Laboratory studies using cancer cells have shown that dandelion root extract has anti-cancer effects, but this has not been proven in humans.A Facebook post claims that “dandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours. Not only that, but it acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory, immune booster, antioxidant and organ detoxifier.”Whilst laboratory studies, on cells outside of a living being and on cells in mice, have shown some anti-cancer effects, this has not been replicated in humans.The post doesn’t provide a source for this information, but as previously described by fact checkers Snopes and USA Today, it is likely to have come from a 2016 article which was published on the Health Eternally web site.The headline reads “Scientists Find Root That Kills 98% of Cancer Cells in Only 48 Hours”, and the article includes a story of 72 year old patient, John Di Carlo who was reportedly being treated at the Windsor Regional Cancer Center, in Ontario, Canada.His leukaemia (a type of white blood cell cancer) had continued to advance despite conventional treatment, but went into remission after he started drinking dandelion tea at home.The article also includes the views of Dr Carolyn Hamm, a doctor at the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre, who is reported to have said at the time that dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.This was reported slightly differently in 2012, where the same patient’s story was reported, and Dr. Hamm was reported to say that dandelion root extract is one of the only things found to help with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.The Windsor Regional Cancer Centre (the centre that Mr. Di Carlo was reportedly treated at, and Dr Hamm was said to have worked at) is known to have conducted studies in this area.The Health Eternally article does not reference any scientific articles, however the specific claim regarding the death of cancer cells within 48 hours potentially came from a University of Windsor study from 2016 which showed that 95% (not 98%) of colon cancer cells were killed within 48 hours of treatment with dandelion root extract.This study did show increased cancer cell death in lab studies and reduced tumour growth in mice that took the extract. But, importantly, this study did not test the extract in humans.The US based Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre website explains that dandelion has long been used in traditional medicine for a wide range of ailments. It points out, however, that “dandelion has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer”.It also warns that because dandelion has an impact on the activity of the hormone oestrogen, it may actually increase the growth of certain types of hormone sensitive cancers.Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK’s head cancer information nurse, told Full Fact: “There is no scientific evidence that dandelion extract is a useful cancer treatment in humans. Any potential new treatment needs to go through rigorous trials in humans before its safety and effectiveness, if any, can be established. We would strongly advise anyone considering taking any supplement or unproven treatment to discuss this with their doctor first.”This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as missing context Because dandelion root has been shown to have some anti-cancer effect in laboratory studies (in vitro and in mice) but not in humans.Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.\n",

      "example: The woman in the photo has not been crowned youngest doctor by Guinness World Records. The last person to officially hold the title was a male US doctorA Facebook post shared tens of thousands of times on social networks claims to show the Guinness World Records holder of “the youngest doctor in the world” - Cornell graduate, Iqbal El-Assaad, a Palestinian refugee who lived in Lebanon. However, these claims are false: a spokeswoman for the Guinness World Records has told AFP there is no record of Assaad.The Facebook and Twitter posts that we’ve archived here, here, here and here feature a photo of a young woman alongside claims that she’s the world’s youngest doctor, named as Iqbal El-Assaad.One of the Facebook post alleged the “20-year-old Palestinian girl became the youngest doctor in the World Guinness record in 2013”.The post has had more than 274,000 Facebook interactions, including 88,360 shares, since it was first shared on January 3, according to social media analysis tool Crowd Tangle.Another Facebook post (see below) shows a screenshot of a tweet captioned “I cover my hair, not my brain, judge me by what’s in my head, not on my head -- Eqbal a 14-year-old Palestinian girl entered the Guinness Book of records for studying to becoming the youngest doctor (sic)”.The post links out to an article (see below) published by The National, an English-language news outlet based in Abu Dhabi.It features an interview with a young woman called Iqbal Al Assaad who according to The National became the youngest ever medical graduate from Cornell University's Qatar branch in 2013 -- the same year that the misleading posts claim she was crowned the world’s youngest doctor.The story uses the same photo that has been circulating in the recent false claims. The caption identifies the picture as a handout from the Weill Cornell Medical College and says it shows Assaad during her graduation ceremony in Doha in 2013.AFP tried calling Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar but was unable to get hold of someone.Guinness World Records rejects claimJessica Spillane, a spokeswoman for Guinness World Records, told AFP that Assaad was not part of its record holders.Moreover, she said the “Youngest Physician” category had been closed because certain qualifications cannot be \"\"standardized internationally”, but was unable to specify when it was dropped.However, Spillane confirmed that the last official record holder had been US ophthalmologist Balamurali Ambati who graduated from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City on May 19, 1995 - a couple of months before his 18th birthday.What we know about AssaadAn online Google search of Assaad's name led to a Harvard-run social networking website, which featured her profile saying she was a clinical fellow in paediatrics at the Boston's Children's hospital.AFP called the hospital and spoke to several nurses who confirmed that Assaad worked there, but has so far been unable to talk with her directly her.A further online search showed that the Dubai-based news site Arabian Business named Assaad as one of the \"\"100 Most Powerful Arab Women\"\" in 2015.She also ranked 82nd on a list of Arab thought leaders on the Global Influence website in 2016.\n",

      "example: This article is more than 3 years old- Kenyatta stressed the importance of micro, small and medium enterprises in the Kenyan economy when addressing the nation in early 2020.- In researching the president’s claims, it became clear that data on the number of MSMEs in Kenya, how many jobs they create and how much they contribute to GDP has been inconsistently surveyed and is not up-to-date.- While available data supports the importance of MSMEs in the Kenyan economy, a lack of cooperation between state agencies makes statistics for the sector difficult to calculate.Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), he said, were a “powerful engine” and the “lifeblood” of the economy.Kenyatta then made three claims about the number of these businesses, how many jobs they create and their contribution to the gross domestic product.We took a closer look at them.We contacted the presidency for evidence for these claims and will update this report with their response.The 80% figure is frequently cited, including by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry in an April 2018 policy brief, and international organisations such as UK think tank Overseas Development Institute.The chamber of commerce’s chief executive Angela Ndambuki referred us to Sahil Shah, when contacted about the chamber’s source for the figure.Shah helped research the policy brief and is project lead for the Kenya Business Guide, a think tank that works to strengthen the country’s business environment. He told Africa Check that their data was from the 2016 survey by the national statistics office. But the majority of small businesses are not officially listed, he said.“You'd only be able to fact check the figure if they were all on a national business register, but the truth is … most of them are not,” Shah said.Data from statistics bureauThe state agency responsible for small businesses, the Micro and Small Enterprise Authority, told Africa Check that it relies on data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.In October 2016 the bureau published the 2016 Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Survey. This, it said, was the “first comprehensive study” on small businesses in Kenya, succeeding the narrower Micro and Small Enterprise Baseline Survey of 1999. It confirmed to Africa Check that the survey was also aimed at getting more data on informal businesses.(Note: In 2017 the statistics agency published a census of establishments, which was done from January to May 2017. A staffer told Africa Check the census had only targeted formally incorporated establishments. It counted 138,190 of them.)Official definitions of MSMEsThe 2016 survey adopted Kenya’s official definition of MSMEs as businesses that have fewer than 100 employees. These include working owners, full-time paid employees, unpaid family workers, part-time workers and apprentices.They were further classified as follows:- Micro enterprises – those with 1 to 9 employees- Small enterprises – 10 to 49 employees- Medium enterprises – 50 to 99 employeesThe survey added that the current law on small businesses, the Micro and Small Enterprises Act of 2012, further defines micro enterprises as those with an annual turnover of less than KSh500,000. Small enterprises have a turnover of between KSh500,000 and KSh5 million. The law does not give an upper threshold for medium-sized businesses.How many small businesses are there in Kenya?The 2016 survey estimated that there were about 1.56 million MSMEs licensed by the 47 county governments, and 5.85 million unlicensed businesses, making for a total of 7.41 million micro, small and medium businesses.To estimate this, the statistics office sampled 50,043 licensed businesses from March to June 2016. An additional 14,000 households were targeted so as to capture household-based enterprises, which it said were largely unlicensed.But the data agency doesn’t have a publication with the number of all businesses in the country, Collins Omondi, its director of macroeconomic statistics, told Africa Check. It is therefore difficult to establish what share of the total number of businesses 7.41 million MSMEs constitutes.For these to constitute 80%, as Kenyatta claimed, Kenya would have 9.26 million businesses in total. We haven’t yet found any data that shows this.Calls for more data collectionIn its 2016 survey, the statistics office called for “a comprehensive scientific MSME inventory”, to be updated every year.Kenya’s tax authority has in recent years introduced laws aimed at collecting data on the number of small businesses, especially those that are not listed and which it has said form the majority.But a spokesperson for the Kenya Revenue Authority, Paul Agonda, told Africa Check the agency did not have “recent data” on small businesses, and referred us back to the statistics bureau and the chamber of commerce.The 2016 Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Survey, published in 2018 by the national statistics office, estimated that smaller businesses employed 14.9 million people.The statistics agency told Africa Check that although data was collected in 2016, it was based on activities in 2015. It estimated that the number of jobs in the country was 15.2 million in 2015, meaning that MSMEs would have accounted for 98% of all jobs in the country.Official data on employment in the Kenyan economy during this period was in the 2015/16 Basic Labour Force Report. It sampled 23,852 households across each of the country’s 47 counties, from September 2015 to August 2016, with 21,734 (91.3%) households successfully interviewed.It found that 17.9 million Kenyans had jobs, while another 1.4 million were classified as unemployed but recommended more research into informal employment. (Note: The most recent data from the statistics agency estimated that 17.8 million people were employed in 2018.)The labour force report released in March 2018 remains the most recent on jobs in Kenya, with the previous labour survey published in 2009. In June 2018 statistics bureau director-general Zachary Mwangi told Africa Check that the agency planned to conduct “annual and quarterly” surveys.The first annual labour force survey would be released in July 2019, Mwangi said. In the event, comparable data for 2015, the year the most recent small business survey covers, is unavailable, again making it difficult to work out their contribution to the country’s jobs.Academic highlights ‘data sharing gaps’Dr Forah Obebo lectures economics at Kenyatta University in Nairobi. He said the inconsistent data collection on small businesses was a challenge for statistics.“We know the nationally representative data was from 2015, and the data before that was published in 1999. But where is the Kenya Revenue Authority’s record? What is the national chamber [of commerce] doing with the information they have?”“Information in the counties is very difficult to get. There are information technology issues and some of the systems are manual or semi-automated … [and] do not necessarily create output you can use,” Obebo said.He highlighted data sharing gaps and said that more interaction between organs of government could help statisticians “triangulate”.READ: Has Kenya’s unemployment really dropped to 7.4%?This claim further adds to the data challenge.Micro, small and medium sized businesses contributed 33.8% of Kenya’s GDP in 2015, the 2016 MSME survey by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics found.This would mean they would have contributed about KSh2.13 trillion of the the GDP, which for 2015 was KSh6.3 trillion.But the small businesses survey gave the contribution of small businesses as KSh1.7 trillion, which it said was the gross value added in 2015 against a national total of KSh 5.7 trillion. This is 30% – Kenyatta’s figure.Published in 2016 with 2015 as the reference year, the MSME survey remains the most recent nationally representative data on the sector. It estimated that there were 7.41 million small businesses in total.But Kenyatta said this was the figure “currently”. Kenya’s most recent GDP was estimated to be KSh8.9 trillion in 2018. One would need to compare the 2018 contribution of MSMEs against this figure, not the estimate from 2015. Without Kenyatta’s office clarifying his evidence, we can also only rate this claim unproven.The lack of comparable and reliable data is a real concern in working out the significance of such an important sector of Kenya’s economy.Add new comment\n",

      "example: A viral set of videos and photos on social media are being shared with a claim that they show Indian origin Canadian Parliamentarian Jagmeet Singh celebrating after being appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.This, however, is a false claim. Jagmeet Singh is NOT the deputy Prime Minister Canada. He is the leader of the New Democratic Party and is serving as a member of the Canadian Parliament for the riding of Burnaby South since 2019.ClaimThe aforementioned video is being widely circulated on Facebook with a claim which reads: “Heartiest Congratulations on Jagmeet Singh becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada. He is first Sikh in world to become Deputy Prime Minister of any country in world. (sic)”Interestingly, the same claim had earlier gone viral on Twitter in October 2019.What We FoundJagmeet Singh scripted history in March 2019 when he made his debut in the Canadian Parliament as the first non-white leader of a major opposition party in the country. Again, in October 2019, he was among the 18 Sikh leaders who were elected to the Canadian Parliament’s lower house, the House of Commons.Even in his Twitter bio, Singh mentions that he is the leader of Canada's New Democratic Party.We searched on Google to find out if Singh was appointed as the country’s deputy Prime Minister as claimed in the viral post. This, however, turned out to be false as Chrystia Freeland currently holds that post.Next, we fragment the video in multiple keyframes and followed it up with a reverse image search. This helped us find a longer version of the same video uploaded by Global News — a Canada-based news network — on YouTube.According to the description of the video dated 22 October 2019, it is from a post-poll speech by the politician.Evidently, a false message is being circulated with an unrelated video to claim that Jagmeet Singh has been appointed as the new deputy Prime Minister of Canada.(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

      "example: This article is more than 3 years old- Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country.- The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog.- But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems.Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache.“[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview, published in August 2020.In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services.In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy.Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”.“We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said.Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%.To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments.For the national budget, we checked budget statements.|Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget|Year|Judiciary budget (KSh billion)|National budget (KSh trillion)|Share|2014/15|17.5|1.58|1.1%|2015/16|16.7|2|0.8%|2016/17|17.3|2.3|0.8%|2017/18|17.6|2.3|0.8%|2018/19|14.5|2.6|0.6%|2019/20|18.9|2.8|0.7%|2020/21|17.4|2.8|0.6%Sources: Budget speeches for 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.Note: The figures shown have been rounded up.Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct.The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19.The report said: “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.”|Total number of cases filed in the judiciary|Financial year|Cases|2014/15|334,685|2015/16|460,961|2016/17|344,180|2017/18|402,243|2018/19|484,349|Average|405,283The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct.Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up.“Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said.The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya.|Number of cases resolved by the judiciary|Financial year|Cases|2014/15|272,605|2015/16|191,625|2016/17|304,182|2017/18|370,488|2018/19|469,359|Average|321,652We therefore rate the claim as correct.There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019.This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct.The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020.Using a population of 47.6 million, this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people.The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated.A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population.But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used. (Note: See box below for more context.)The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary.We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the \"\"global average\"\" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response.Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population.It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017.But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries.“The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases.“Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.”Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven.|Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful?The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina, a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check.He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services.However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”.“A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said.“Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.”Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute, an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload.A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said.Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take, may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges.But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said.He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.”“The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.”“A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.”Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, KenyaFurther reading:https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/Add new comment\n",

      "example: “Research conducted for the Department of Health found that only 11% of people asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace have done so.”Annaliese Dodds MP, 17 November 2020“It is estimated that only about 11% of people self-isolate when they are asked to do so—11%. That is not because they do not want to; it is because many do not feel that they can afford to do so.”Sir Keir Starmer MP, 18 November 2020“At the moment only 11% of people who are asked to self-isolate through the NHS app are actually able to do so, many of them not eligible for a one-off payment to help them do that.”Lisa Nandy MP, 29 November 2020“We still need to fix the gaps in contact tracing and in financial support for those who need to self-isolate. Only 11% of people are being contacted, according to the figures that I am getting.”Bill Esterson MP, 8 December 2020We’ve seen several Labour MPs use an 11% figure to talk about self-isolating in a variety of ways—which seem to be getting less accurate over time. We’ve written to the Labour party and will update this article with their response.The number apparently originates in a government-funded research paper (not yet peer-reviewed), which sought to understand whether people were following the self-isolation rules.The paper draws on data collected in a series of surveys from March this year until the beginning of August (although the data about test and trace only covers the last two months of this period, after the service launched).In particular, the 11% figure seems to come from the finding that: “Of [the 405 people] who reported having been alerted by the NHS contact tracing service and told they had been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 10.9% reported that they had not left home at all in the following 14 days.”This means that it didn’t cover people who needed to self-isolate because they tested positive or had symptoms themselves.Staying at home for 14 days was the minimum requirement for those self-isolating for this reason until 13 December. It has now been shortened to 10, although people who develop or continue to have Covid symptoms during this period may need to stay at home for longer. People are allowed in their gardens or private outdoor spaces during this time, but otherwise must stay inside “except in certain specific circumstances”. These include funerals, legal obligations and medical emergencies.The paper observed a slightly higher rate of self-isolation compliance, at 18.2%, among people who actually had Covid symptoms, and did not measure the proportion of people correctly self-isolating following a positive test.The Shadow Chancellor, Annaliese Dodds, therefore used the 11% number correctly in a letter she wrote to the Chancellor on 17 November (as long as we understand her to mean people who are asked to self-isolate as contacts, not because they tested positive).However, it is important to be clear about what the number means, and what it doesn’t.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inWhy did people break the rules?Ms Dodds used the 11% figure as part of an argument that the government should expand the Test and Trace Support Payment (TTSP)—a scheme introduced in England and Wales in September to replace some of the lost income of eligible people who have to self-isolate.However, the TTSP did not exist when the research she mentions was conducted, so it might have already improved the proportion of people self-isolating.The researchers found that not following the self-isolation rules in general was associated with “men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socioeconomic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector.” They suggested that “Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence.”However, the reasons people actually gave for not self-isolating do not suggest that they were primarily concerned about the financial cost of self-isolation.Only 8.9% of those who reported not self-isolating correctly said it was “to go out to work”. Other reasons—such as not having symptoms, going to the shops, or not thinking the rule was necessary—were more common.To be clear, self-isolation may have placed a financial burden on many people, and paying people to self-isolate may improve their adherence to the rules, but this research does not suggest that many people broke the rules for financial reasons.It therefore does not support the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer’s claim during Prime Minister’s Questions on 18 November that when people do not follow the rules, “That is not because they do not want to; it is because many do not feel that they can afford to do so.”Things were different in the summerThe Shadow Foreign Secretary, Lisa Nandy, also used a similar figure on the Andrew Marr Show on 29 November.She said: “At the moment only 11% of people who are asked to self-isolate by the NHS app are actually able to do so, many of them not eligible for a one-off payment to help them do that.”We have not yet heard back from Ms Nandy about the source for this figure, but if it comes from the same research, then her summary was not correct for several reasons.As we have seen, the data in this research was collected up to the beginning of August, so it does not tell us about people’s behaviour “at the moment”, when she was speaking. For the same reason, it does not refer to people notified by the NHS contact tracing app, which was not launched until 24 September.Ms Nandy was also wrong to say that only 11% of people were “able” to self-isolate when required to. The survey only asked them whether they did, not whether they could.Are only 11% of contacts reached?On 8 December, the Shadow Minister for International Trade, Bill Esterson, again used an 11% figure while talking about financial support for people who self-isolate, but this time it meant something entirely different.Speaking in Parliament, he said: “We still need to fix the gaps in contact tracing and in financial support for those who need to self-isolate. Only 11% of people are being contacted, according to the figures that I am getting.” The Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, replied that the true figure “is much higher than that”.Mr Esterson has not yet replied to our question about where this figure comes from. It may be a mistake, in which he has muddled the percentage of people who said they did not self-isolate with the percentage of people who are contacted in the first place.This second figure can be expressed in several different ways, some of them impossible to calculate precisely. In the latest statistics that were publicly available when Mr Esterson was speaking, 83.8% of close contacts of people who tested positive were reached and told to self-isolate (when communication details for those individuals were available).If we look at all close contacts (including those without communication details) the figure is 72.5%.Some infected people do not get tested, or cannot be reached, or do not provide any contacts, so an unknown number of other close contacts are missed by the tracing system. So it’s hard to say how much lower the figure would be if we took account of all them.If this was the figure that Mr Esterson had in mind, then from the data available it does not seem possible for him or anyone else to know that it was 11%.\n",

The claim is false; the footage actually shows Indonesian government officials promoting the consumption of pork at an event on the island of Bali, after the Hindu-majority province was hit with an outbreak of African Swine Fever.This video was published on Facebook on February 22, 2020. It has been viewed more than one million times and shared some 11,000 times.The one-minute, 55-second video shows several men eating a whole roasted pig, while standing in front of an Indonesian-language sign that reads: “Don’t be afraid to eat pork meat; Pork meat is safe for consumption”.Below is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:The Malaysian-language caption translates to English in part as: “Latest news, the Indonesian government is officially announcing today that all Malays can eat pork from today. The Chinese has a headache, and the price of pork meat will surely rocket in the future. Follow eat only, no other way.

The Agriculture and Food Security Services of Bali province conducted a campaign to eat suckling pig together, Friday (February 7, 2020). This was done to raise the society’s awareness not to be afraid of eating pork in the midst of the African Swine Fever (ASF) virus.”On February 5, 2020, Bali confirmed an African Swine Fever outbreak on the island. Officials said more than 800 pigs had been killed in the past few months, adding they believed the disease had been contained.While Muslims make up most of the population in Indonesia, Bali is a Hindu-majority province of Indonesia.

      "example: AAP FactCheck Investigation: Did police numbers decrease during NZ Opposition leader Judith Collins’ time as police minister?The Statement“Unfortunately, under Judith Collins we saw a decrease in police and so that to me is the fundamental foundation of any response to increases in gang activity.”Jacinda Ardern, NZ Prime Minister, August 11, 2020.The AnalysisNew Zealand National says it will crack down on gang crime, but the coalition says Judith Collins presided over a drop in police numbers and reversing that should be the first step.In a law and order policy factsheet released on August 11, National said that in the past three years the government had overseen a 34 per cent increase in patched gang members (Page 2).National announced that, if elected, it would give police greater powers to search the homes and cars of violent gang members for firearms, support police to establish a dedicated gang unit, and create new criminal offences targeting violent gang crime, alongside tougher sentences for gang-related crime.But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told radio station RNZ’s Checkpoint program (mark 3mins 35sec) the key to combating gang crime was more frontline police.“And that, I believe, is what will make the biggest difference. Unfortunately, under Judith Collins we saw a decrease in police and so that to me is the fundamental foundation of any response to increases in gang activity,” Ms Ardern said.AAP FactCheck has examined Ms Ardern’s claim that under Ms Collins there was a decrease in police.Ms Collins, who was police minister under the previous National government between November 2008 and December 2011 and again from December 2015 to December 2016, admitted in August 2016 her government had not kept up with its target of one officer for every 500 people living in New Zealand. (Mark 34sec).At the time, there was about one officer to every 526 people, she said. (Mark 55sec). But, in early November 2017, Ms Collins rejected incoming Labour police minister Stuart Nash’s assertions National had failed to put more police on the beat. (Mark 35sec).In a 2017 interview on the AM Show, Ms Collins said the National government had increased the police force by 600. (Mark 22sec)In an emailed statement, NZ Police provided AAP FactCheck with constabulary numbers for 2008 to 2020, as at June each year. The figures, which are not routinely published nor publicly available, show officer numbers as distinct from the total number of NZ Police employees.According to NZ Police, in June 2008, there were 8,211 police officers. Ms Collins first became police minister in November 2008.The NZ Police figures show officer numbers then rose to 8,643 in June 2009 and 8,707 in June 2010, before dropping to 8,638 in June 2011.Ms Collins’ portfolios changed in December 2011, but she returned to the role of police minister in December 2015.There were 8,923 police officers in June 2015 and this dropped to 8,899 in June 2016. Ms Collins portfolios changed again in December 2016.While there were some year-on-year decreases in the number of police officers during Ms Collins’ stints as police minister, officer numbers increased overall by 688.However, when measured as a ratio of the population of New Zealand, police numbers decreased.According to a table of Census data showing the past 29 years, there were an estimated 4,259,800 people resident in NZ in June 2008. The population rose to 4,302,600 in June 2009; 4,350,700 in June 2010; 4,384,000 in June 2011; 4,585,600 in June 2015; and 4,678,100 in June 2016.AAP FactCheck calculated police numbers as a ratio of the resident population for the years in which Judith Collins was police minister by dividing the population figures by the constabulary numbers for the corresponding year.This revealed there was one police officer for every 519 NZ residents in June 2008, one for every 498 residents in June 2009, 1/500 in 2010, 1/507 in 2011, 1/514 in 2015 and 1/526 in 2016.The VerdictPolice NZ data shows actual police numbers rose between 2008 and 2016, during which time Ms Collins served two distinct periods as police minister.When police numbers are described as an officer to resident ratio, they show an improvement during Ms Collins’ first period as police minister (from 1/519 in 2008, to 1/507 in 2011).However, during Ms Collins’ second run as police minister, population growth in NZ largely outstripped the growth in police numbers (1/514 in 2015 to 1/526 in 2016). This is also true when you compare police to resident ratios for 2008 to the same data for 2016.This means NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is only correct to say police numbers fell under Judith Collins when those figures are expressed as police per head of population.Somewhat False – The claim has a problem or inaccuracy but it does contain a significant element or elements of truth.* AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/All information, text and images included on the AAP Websites is for personal use only and may not be re-written, copied, re-sold or re-distributed, framed, linked, shared onto social media or otherwise used whether for compensation of any kind or not, unless you have the prior written permission of AAP.

Fox News reported:The United States is on track to hit President Joe Biden’s goal of vaccinating 100 million Americans against coronavirus on Friday, just 58 days after his inauguration. In an update provided Thursday, Biden said that while the number is encouraging, the country still has much work to do before it can declare victory against the virus.\"\"Tomorrow, we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered,\"\" Biden said. \"\"I’ve always said that’s just the floor, we will not stop until we beat this pandemic. Next week I’ll announce our next goal to put shots in arms.\"\"During his speech, Biden was talking about how his administration was supplying vaccines to community health centers serving Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities when he accidentally referred to his vice president as \"\"President Harris\"\":Here's an excerpt from this portion of this speech:We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit.

      "example: Misleading claim circulates online about Wuhan's coronavirus death toll after lockdown easedA post has been shared repeatedly on Facebook by Sri Lankan Facebook users that claims 1,290 people died from coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan after the city's lockdown was lifted on April 8, 2020. The posts claim that Sri Lanka should avoid lifting its own lockdown restrictions due to an upcoming election in order to avoid a similar spike in deaths. The claim is misleading; Chinese officials added 1,290 fatalities to Wuhan's coronavirus death toll after the city lifted restrictions on April 8, but said these were COVID-19 cases that were missed during the earlier lockdown.The claim was published here on Facebook on April 18, 2020. It has been shared more than 17,000 times.Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:The Sinhala-language post translates to English as: “China's Wuhan asked for the 1290 deaths recorded yesterday, by opening the city.Let's make sure we dont experience the same plight because of elections.\"\"China ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have first emerged, on April 8, 2020. Here is an AFP report on the re-opening of the city.Sri Lanka is set to hold elections on June 20, 2020. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa issued this gazette on March 2, 2020 dissolving the Parliament, thus announcing a general election on April 25, 2020. As the COVID-19 crisis deepened, the Election Commission said a gazette was issued on April 20, 2020 anouncing the delay of polls until June.A similar claim was also been shared here, here, here and here on Facebook.The claim is misleading; Chinese officials did raise its death toll for Wuhan by 1,290 on April 17, 2020, but authorities said these were cases that were “belated, missed and mistaken” at the peak of the pandemic.A keyword search found this report published by China’s state news agency Xinhua on April 17, 2020, which includes a full transcript of the statement issued by officials in Wuhan.It states, in part: “The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan as of the end of April 16 was revised up by 325 to 50,333, and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869.”The report listed several reasons for “the data discrepancies”, saying: “First, a surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.“Second, during the height of their treating efforts, hospitals were operating beyond their capacities and medical staff were preoccupied with saving and treating patients, resulting in belated, missed and mistaken reporting.“Third, due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients, including those administered by ministries, Hubei Province, Wuhan city and its districts, those affiliated to companies, as well as private hospitals and makeshift hospitals, a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network and failed to report their data in time.“Fourth, the registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting.”According to this daily report issued by China’s National Health Commission on April 22, 2020, no new COVID-related deaths were recorded in Hubei province immediately after the lockdown was lifted in Wuhan.It reads, in part: “On April 21, Hubei province reported no new cases of confirmed infections, no new cases of suspected infections, and no deaths. 5 patients (all in Wuhan) were released from hospital after being cured.”\n",

      "example: What was claimedFrom 21 July to 25 July, 12 people died from Covid-19 in Spain.Our verdictBroadly correct. Around 10 people in Spain died after testing positive with Covid-19, so this figure will miss out some Covid-19 deaths.Correct.From 21 July to 25 July, 12 people died from Covid-19 in Spain.Broadly correct. Around 10 people in Spain died after testing positive with Covid-19, so this figure will miss out some Covid-19 deaths.Correct.From 21 July to 25 July the UK reported 426 Covid-19 deaths.Correct. This figure is the number of deaths registered after a positive test, so will miss out some Covid-19 deaths.It’s wrong to suggest Spain is in worse shape than the UK as the UK has a much higher Covid-19 death toll.Looking at the number of cases is more relevant and Spain had many more new cases than the UK at the end of July.A viral Facebook post compares the number of Covid-19 deaths in the UK with the number in Spain, saying it is wrong to suggest that Spain is “in worse shape than the UK.”This follows the decision by the government in July to remove Spain from a list of countries which UK travellers can return from and not have to quarantine. Additionally the Foreign & Commonwealth Office advises British nationals against all but essential travel to Spain.The post, which dates from 26 July, claims that there were 426 Covid-19 related deaths in the previous five days in the UK, while there were only 12 from Spain.The figures are correct, but when comparing the risk of contracting Covid-19 in each country, it’s better to look at the number of new cases. Spain had around 2.6 times more cases than the UK in the week of 20 July, despite having a smaller population.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailThe statistic of 426 for the UK is accurate, but it’s worth putting in context. The UK registered 426 deaths between 21 July and 25 July of people who died after testing positive for Covid-19.Because these statistics are based on when deaths are registered rather than when they happen, some of those 426 people will have died prior to 21 July.Also, these only capture deaths where Covid-19 has been determined by a positive test result. This means the deaths of people from Covid-19 who weren’t tested aren’t included in this figure. Data on how many suspected Covid-19 deaths there have been, whether or not confirmed by a test, is published here, but does not yet have data for the full period in question.Between 21 and 25 July, Our World in Data, a data publication managed out of the University of Oxford, says there were 10 confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Spain, rather than 12 as the post says.Nacho Calle, a fact checker at the Spanish fact checking organisation Maldita told Full Fact that, as with the UK data “those data are just about people who died with a previous PCR test positive, that means, those deceased who are known to have been infected.”This means deaths of suspected but not test-confirmed Covid-19 are not included.The number of deaths isn't the most useful figure to look at to understand how risky Spain is compared to the UK right now.That’s because deaths now could have been caused by infections that happened a long time ago. To look at the current risk, it’s better to look at how many more cases there are in each country.Data on the number of cases isn’t particularly comparable because it depends on how much testing each country is doing.Nevertheless, we can see that Spain reported around 12,000 new cases in the week of 20 July, while the UK reported around 4,600, despite having a much larger population.Cases in Spain have been roughly doubling week-on-week, while cases in the UK are broadly flat.This article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this—and find out how to report Facebook content—here. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as true as the figures are correct, though it should be noted that death data doesn’t tell you much about the current risk.Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.\n",

      "example: What was claimedThe new coronavirus is 400-500 micro and for this reason wide enough to be stopped by masks.Our verdictThe virus is 50-200 nanometres wide, and a mask, although sometimes necessary, won’t guarantee that you don’t get Covid-19.The new coronavirus is 400-500 micro and for this reason wide enough to be stopped by masks.The virus is 50-200 nanometres wide, and a mask, although sometimes necessary, won’t guarantee that you don’t get Covid-19.The new coronavirus does not settle in the air but is grounded so it is not transmitted by air.The virus can spread via sneeze and cough droplets that can move a short distance through the air and into someone else’s system.Coronavirus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, but can be prevented with alcohol hand sanitiser.It’s not clear how long the virus can ‘survive’ on hands, but hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol is a good second choice to washing your hands with soap and water.Coronavirus lives for 12 hours on metal surfaces.We don’t know how long the virus can survive on surfaces yet, it could be between hours and days.Gargling with warm and salt water kills germs on the tonsils and prevents them from leaking into the lungs.There’s no evidence gargling with saline will cure or prevent Covid-19.If the new coronavirus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27ºC it will be killed, as it does not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick and staying away from ice cream and cold food is advised.There have been cases of Covid-19 in areas with warmer temperatures than this, and we don’t know what temperatures the virus can withstand. There’s no evidence that hot water and the sun will cure it or that staying away from cold food can prevent it.Coronavirus stays on fabric for 9 hours, so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it.We don’t know how long the virus can survive on fabric. There isn’t evidence that it can transmit from fabrics to people, though soiled clothing from Covid-19 patients should be washed normally.We’ve seen a number of tweets showing graphics which make claims about the new coronavirus. The graphics have Unicef branding and are reportedly spreading on WhatsApp.Unicef in the Philippines has said that the graphics are not from them. Most of the claims here are unevidenced or just plain false.The claims seem to have been lifted from a Facebook post which we have checked before. The original text of the post, which has been edited since we first fact checked it, makes some of the same claims about the symptoms of Covid-19 and ways to prevent the disease.It seems that at one point, MSN had an article on its website repeating the claims and attributing them to Unicef though the article has now been deleted.The World Health Organisation (WHO) calls the disease itself Covid-19, and the virus that causes it SARS-CoV-2, and we will use that naming system here.“Corona virus (Covid-19) is large in size where the cell diameter is 400-500 micro and for this reason any mask prevents its entry.”The SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is around 50-200 nanometres wide. “Any mask” will not prevent you catching it. The WHO says masks are only effective when combined with regular hand washing. Viruses like this can enter through the eyes even if you’re wearing a mask.“The virus does not settle in the air but is grounded so it is not transmitted by air.”It’s not completely obvious what this means. The virus that causes Covid-19 certainly can spread through cough and sneeze droplets in the air, which can in turn enter someone else’s system.“Corona virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, so putting an alcohol sterililzer in the pocket meets the purpose of prevention.”As we’ve said before, it’s not clear exactly how long the virus can ‘survive’ on your hands, especially not down to the minute. Using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser is a good way to prevent the virus from spreading, if washing your hands with soap and water isn’t possible.“Corona virus when it falls on a metal surface, it will live 12 hours, so washing hands with soap and water well enough.”We don’t know exactly how long the virus can last on surfaces yet. The WHO says “Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.It’s still good advice to wash your hands regularly with soap and water.“Gargle with warm and salt water kills the tonsils germs and prevents them from leaking into the lungs.”As we’ve written about before, gargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat, but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The WHO has said that there’s no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19.Other fact checkers have also written about this claim, which was attributed to respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, a key figure during the SARS outbreak. The hospital where he worked debunked the rumour via a post on social media site Weibo.“If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27ºC. It will be killed, as it does not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick and staying away from ice cream and cold food is advised.”We don’t yet know what temperatures the virus can withstand, but it’s worth noting that several of the countries with confirmed cases have warmer climates where the temperature can reach 27ºC. Sun exposure is therefore unlikely to protect you from or cure Covid-19. There’s no official advice from the NHS, WHO or CDC to stay away from cold food like ice cream or drink hot water to kill the virus.“Coronavirus when it falls on the fabric remains 9 hours, so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it.”We don’t know how long the new virus can last on fabric, especially this soon after it was discovered. In a blogpost, Harvard Medical School’s instructor in medicine Todd Ellerin writes: “So far, available evidence suggests it can be transmitted less easily from soft surfaces than frequently-touched hard surfaces.”The CDC advises that soiled clothing from Covid-19 patients should be handled with disposable gloves, but can be washed using normal detergent. There’s absolutely no evidence that leaving clothes in the sun can kill the virus.Full Fact fights for good, reliable information in the media, online, and in politics.\n",

      "example: An online article by science pressure group the Health Advisory and Recovery Team (HART) has claimed a video by children’s TV show Newsround made a number of misleading claims about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children.Since the video was released, Newsround made one correction in an accompanying article on its website stating “the claim that the vaccine is 100% safe has been removed from an online transcript of this article.”It also included a statement from UK drug regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).It said: \"\"We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk.\"\"However, a number of other claims HART made are themselves misleading.Honesty in public debate mattersYou can help us take action – and get our regular free emailI’m inClaim: The Pfizer vaccine trials were too small to detect adverse effects and prove efficacyHART said this Pfizer trial was “grossly underpowered” to detect relatively rare serious events as only 1,131 children received the vaccine in the trial and claimed that seven of the children in the trial had severe adverse events associated with the vaccine, one of which was life-threatening.It also raised questions over the ability of the trial to demonstrate efficacy, claiming that because the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 in children is so low, you would need to vaccinate more than two million people to detect one death.It is true that the trial, which had over 6,000 participants, was too small to detect very rare adverse events. Dr Jason Oke, senior statistician at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, told Full Fact “Trials are rarely, if ever, of sufficient size (or powered) to detect differences in rare adverse events and this trial...is no exception.“So, I would say that [HART’s] statement is not incorrect but I would suggest that this issue is not unique to this study.”While seven serious adverse events were detected among the vaccine trial group, none of the events were recorded as being related to the vaccine.HART’s assessment of Pfizer’s efficacy data (which found 18 cases of Covid-19 in the unvaccinated group, and none in the vaccinated group) appears to only consider vaccination worthwhile if it prevents death.While the trial was too small to detect a difference in Covid-19 deaths, that was not its purpose. It set out to measure the impact of efficacy of vaccines in reducing the risk of Covid-19, and found the vaccine worked. As Full Fact and others have reported, the vaccine is not only to reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19 (which we have previously reported is close to one in 100,000 in children who catch the disease) but to reduce non-lethal but harmful symptomatic Covid-19, transmission of the disease, and long Covid.Claim: An independent review has advised that all Covid-19 vaccination should be halted because of the number of deaths and adverse events it has caused.HART also cited an open letter to CEO of the MHRA Dr June Raine as evidence of the vaccines’ harmfulness, claiming it was an “independent preliminary Yellow Card reporting review (which) advises that all COVID-19 vaccination should be halted, pending a full independent safety enquiry.” The “review” argues that 1,253 deaths and 888,196 adverse reactions (ADR) reported via the Yellow Card Scheme were “covid-19 vaccine attributed”.We’ve said on a number of occasions that reporting of deaths and adverse events following a vaccine does not mean they are connected.Some adverse events have been investigated and are possibly linked to vaccination. The MHRA has received reports of 389 cases of blood clotting following the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which 68 were fatal. Its advice remains “that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks in the majority of people.” Under 40s however are being offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine.According to the latest statistics, there have been 395 instances of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions in response to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 16 instances after the Moderna vaccine and 760 after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine or hypersensitivity to the Moderna vaccine have been told to not receive those vaccines.Reports of Bell’s Palsy (a type of facial paralysis) have been analysed but “so far is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines.”There have been eight reports of Capillary Leak Syndrome (where fluid leaks from the small blood vessels into the body, which can lead to organ failure and death). While it is an extremely rare condition, whose triggers are not well understood, the MHRA has advised the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be used by anyone with a history of such episodes.The MHRA also monitored reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammatory heart conditions) following vaccination. It says the reports are “very rare”, “typically mild” and people should attend for vaccination when invited “unless advised otherwise.”A range of menstrual disorders have been reported after the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines but the number of reports are said to be low in relation to the number of women who have had their vaccine and how common such disorders are generally.Of other adverse events with a fatal outcome following vaccination “review of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest the vaccine played a role in the death.”Claim: Because children have more active immune systems, they will generate more spike proteins which are now linked to “harms”.HART also claimed that children produce more spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine.It claimed recent evidence shows these proteins are harmful. We believe this refers to statements made by viral immunologist Byram Bridle who claimed, just as spike proteins from the Covid-19 virus can enter the bloodstream and cause cellular damage, so can spike proteins generated by the Covid-19 vaccine.While we don’t know whether children produce more spike proteins following vaccination we recently fact checked Mr Bridle’s comments. Spike proteins generated by the vaccines work differently to those generated by the Covid-19 virus, and so the assumption that spike proteins generated by the vaccine could also harm cells in the bloodstream is unevidenced..His theory has also been addressed by a number of other scientists and fact checkers.Claim: There is a distinct likelihood Covid-19 vaccinations causes myocarditis in childrenHART also noted Newsround hadn’t mentioned some of the Pfizer vaccine's side effects, citing a recent FDA report and an upcoming U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emergency meeting on associated myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart, which can lead to heart failure).The CDC reported earlier this month that more than half of the myocarditis cases reported to the U.S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System after the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines were in people aged between 12 and 24.This has led to the FDA adding a warning to the Pfizer and Modera vaccines.As noted earlier, the MHRA has received reports of myocarditis following vaccination but say instances are very rare, events were typically mild and individuals should still come forward for their vaccine unless advised not to.\n",

Because these are emergencies requiring urgent treatment, Alexa first tells the user to call 911 before offering other instructions.The skill is important, the AHA noted, because, \"\"A 2015 study reported that about half of all communities do not have 911 dispatchers trained to give CPR instruction, as the AHA recommends.\"\"An Amazon spokesperson informed us that in case of an emergency, the first thing anyone should do is call for emergency responders, which in the U.S. means dialing 911.A disclaimer from Amazon states, \"\"These first aid skills are for informational and educational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional first aid training, medical advice, treatment or diagnosis. If you think you have a medical emergency, please call your local emergency number. Calling your local emergency number is almost always the fastest way to get lifesaving treatment.\"\"\n",
